How (not) to Forecast A Papal Conclave
======================================

Some code where I play around with some very basic techniques to simulate the [papal selection process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_conclave), including web scraping, document comparison and agent-based modeling.

A full explanation of the process is being written up in **[Conclave_Modeling_Tutorial.ipynb](https://raw.github.com/dmasad/Pope_Forecasting/master/Conclave_Modeling_Tutorial.ipynb)**

Very much a work in progress!
