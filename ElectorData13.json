(born 2 December 1934) is an Italian prelate and a Vatican diplomat. A cardinal of the Catholic Church, he currently serves as Cardinal Secretary of State and Camerlengo, having previously served as Archbishop of Vercelli from 1991 to 1995, as Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, when Cardinal Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI, was Prefect, and Archbishop of Genoa from 2002 to 2006. Bertone was elevated to the cardinalate in 2003. On 10 May 2008, he was named Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati. Besides his native Italian, Bertone speaks fluent French, Spanish, German and Portuguese. He has some knowledge of English, although he is not fluent, and he can read Polish, Latin, Greek and Hebrew.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life\n2 Archbishop and Cardinal\n3 Cardinal Secretary of State\n\n3.1 Evaluation of dicasteries\n3.2 Church and sports\n3.3 Defence of Pius XII\n3.4 Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy\n3.5 Comments by Patriarch Alexius II\n3.6 Le Figaro interview\n3.7 Proposed excommunication of drug dealers\n3.8 Support for universal and free access to anti-AIDS drugs\n3.9 Vatican leaks\n3.10 Ash Wednesday speech\n\n\n4 Criticisms\n\n4.1 Controversial statements on child abuse within the Church\n4.2 Political controversies in the Roman Curia\n4.3 Third Secret of Fatima controversy\n\n\n5 Awards and honours\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life\nBertone was born in Romano Canavese, Piedmont, the fifth of eight children. Bertone has stated that his mother was a determined anti-Fascist militant of the Italian People's Party, and later a Christian Democrat.\nHe professed his vows as a member of the Salesians on 3 December 1950, and was ordained a priest by Archbishop Albino Mensa on 1 July 1960. He holds a doctorate in canon law. His dissertation was entitled The Governance of the Church in the Thought of Pope Benedict XIV (1740\u20131758).[1] He served as Professor of Special Moral Theology at the Pontifical Salesian University from 1967 until his appointment as Professor of Canon Law in 1976, a post he held until 1991. He was a visiting professor of Public Ecclesiastical Law at the Institute Utriusque Iuris of the Pontifical Lateran University in 1978. In 1988 he was appointed to a group of experts that assisted Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in negotiations with the then-excommunicated Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. He was also commissioned by Pope John Paul II to assist Emmanuel Milingo, Archbishop Emeritus of Lusaka, Zambia, in returning to the Catholic Church in 2001. Milingo had left the Church to marry Maria Sung of the Moon sect.[2]\n[edit] Archbishop and Cardinal\nOn 4 July 1991, Bertone was appointed Archbishop of Vercelli by Pope John Paul II. He was consecrated a bishop one month later by Archbishop Mensa, who had also ordained him. He held this post until his resignation in 1995 upon being named Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under Cardinal Ratzinger, who would later become Pope Benedict XVI. Appointed Archbishop of Genoa on 10 December 2002 and installed on 2 February 2003, Bertone was elevated to the College of Cardinals in the consistory of 21 October 2003, as Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria Ausiliatrice in Via Tuscolana. Then-Archbishop Angelo Amato succeeded Bertone as Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, before becoming the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.\nAs a member of the Society of Don Bosco, he is considered a priest who has undertaken work with youth whom, in Pope John Paul's last words, he had sought throughout his papacy. Bertone's secretary once related a story that \"Bertone once decided to take a public bus to the Apostolic Palace. As the Cardinal in his long black cassock and red fascia strode on to the bus, the people, especially a group of young people, stared in silence. Bertone immediately broke the ice with his 'characteristic' smile. By the time he reached his destination the prelate had engaged the youth in a deep conversation on love, sex, virginity, and chastity\".[3]\nHe later specialized in the relationship between social morality, faith and politics. He also assisted with the revision of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, and undertook pastoral work in parishes. In the Jubilee Year 2000, Cardinal Bertone was entrusted by John Paul II with the publication of the third part of the secret of Fatima.\nBertone was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Bertone is eligible to vote in the 2013 conclave and any future conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on 2 December 2014.\nOn 15 March 2005, Bertone was in the news for \"breaking the Church's silence\" and sharply criticizing Dan Brown's 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code, saying the book was \"shameful and unfounded lies\", and that believers should boycott the book. Both Bertone and official Vatican spokespeople insisted that Bertone was not speaking as an official representative of the Church, but it was also noted that Bertone's high placement within the Church hierarchy (his name was often cited as a potential candidate for the next pontiff) gave his words considerable weight, such that his comments were often reported by various media as an official statement from the Vatican.[4] In 2006, the NBC news program Dateline described his statement as \"a high-ranking Vatican Cardinal called for a boycott of the film.\"\n[edit] Cardinal Secretary of State\n\n\nStyles of\nTarcisio Bertone, SDB\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nFrascati (Suburbicarian)\n\n\nOn 22 June 2006, Benedict XVI appointed Cardinal Bertone to replace Angelo Sodano as the Cardinal Secretary of State, assuming the office on 15 September of that same year. On 26 June 2006 Cardinal Bertone was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.[5]\nIt was revealed on the following 31 August that Cardinal Bertone had a dream in which Pope John Paul II spoke to him saying \"do not be afraid\" to the Cardinal as he prepared to take his new job.[6]\nOn 4 April 2007, Benedict XVI also appointed Cardinal Bertone as Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church (or Chamberlain). The duties of the Camerlengo are largely confined to administration during the vacancy of the Holy See.[7] On 10 May 2008 he was promoted to the rank of Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati.[8]\nBertone is known to study the problem at hand before taking action. One such example is when after he was named Archbishop of Vercelli he \"locked himself in his room all night and studied the life of Saint Eusebius, who was bishop of the city back in 345 AD\".[3]\nHe is a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Congregation for the Clergy, Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Congregation for the Oriental Churches, Congregation for Bishops and Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. He will hold these memberships until his 80th birthday on 2 December 2014.\n[edit] Evaluation of dicasteries\nTwo weeks before entering office, Bertone was interviewed and asked his opinion about reforms of the Roman Curia. Bertone remarked, \"After almost two decades, an evaluation of how the dicasteries are organised is more than comprehensible, in order to reflect on how to make the existing structures more efficient for the mission of the Church and eventually to consider whether all of them should be maintained\".[9]\n[edit] Church and sports\nCardinal Bertone suggested in December 2006 that the Holy See \"could, in future, field a team that plays at the top level, with Roma, Internazionale, Genoa and Sampdoria.\" He continued by saying, \"If we just take the Brazilian students from our Pontifical universities we could have a magnificent squad\".[10] However, only hours later he said, \"I've got much more to do than cultivating a football squad for the Vatican\", and explained that his earlier remark was not intended to be taken seriously.[11]\n[edit] Defence of Pius XII\nOn 5 June 2007, at a conference announcing the release of a new biography of Pope Pius XII, Bertone defended Pius against claims of indifference toward the Jews during The Holocaust. The Cardinal condemned this accusation as a \"black legend\" and \"an attack on good sense and on rationality\", which has \"become so firmly established that even to scratch it is an arduous task\".[12] Although he admitted that Pius XII had been \"cautious\" in condemning Nazi Germany, Bertone stated that Nazi forces would have intensified its program of genocide had the Pope been more outspoken.\n[edit] Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy\nSee also: Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy\nOn 16 September 2006, Cardinal Bertone, after only one day in his job as Cardinal Secretary of State, released a declaration explaining that the \"position of the Pope concerning Islam is unequivocally that expressed by the conciliar document Nostra Aetate\" and that \"the Pope's option in favour of inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue is equally unequivocal.\"[13]\n\nAs for the opinion of the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus which he quoted during his Regensburg talk, the Holy Father did not mean, nor does he mean, to make that opinion his own in any way. He simply used it as a means to undertake\u2014in an academic context, and as is evident from a complete and attentive reading of the text\u2014certain reflections on the theme of the relationship between religion and violence in general, and to conclude with a clear and radical rejection of the religious motivation for violence, from whatever side it may come. [The Pope] sincerely regrets that certain passages of his address could have sounded offensive to the sensitivities of the Muslim faithful and should have been interpreted in a manner that in no way corresponds to his intentions.[14][15] (emphasis as in original)\n\n[edit] Comments by Patriarch Alexius II\nOn 5 December 2006, Patriarch Alexius II accused the Holy See of an \"extremely unfriendly policy\"[16] when he said that the Catholic Church was poaching converts in Orthodox lands in Russia and other ex-Soviet republics. In response, Cardinal Bertone said, \"We do not want to engage in proselytism in Russia\".[17]\n[edit] Le Figaro interview\nOn 31 March 2007, Cardinal Bertone confirmed Pope Benedict's impending publication of the long-expected motu proprio extending the indult for the celebration of the Tridentine Mass in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro.[18][19][20]\nIn the same interview, Bertone \"blasted the media for highlighting the Vatican's views on sex while maintaining a 'deafening silence' about charity work done by thousands of Catholic organisations around the world.\"[21] He continued by saying, \"I see a fixation by some journalists on moral topics, such as abortion and homosexual unions, which are certainly important issues but absolutely do not constitute the thinking and work of the Church.\"\n[edit] Proposed excommunication of drug dealers\nOn 14 January 2009, Cardinal Bertone suggested that the Church would consider taking much stronger action against drug dealers. This action might possibly include excommunication. He made a statement about the Church's alarm at the \"disaster\" of drug-fuelled violence on the eve of a trip to Mexico. [4]\n[edit] Support for universal and free access to anti-AIDS drugs\nOn Friday, June 22, 2012, in an online news story article by Cindy Wooden of Catholic News Service (CNS), it was reported that, in a conference in Rome on the prevention of the transmission of AIDS from mothers to children sponsored by the lay Community of Sant'Egidio (which runs the DREAM project, a free AIDS prevention/treatment program in 10 African countries), the Cardinal Secretary of State urged that full and easy access to antiretroviral drugs be made free worldwide (these are drugs, such as AZT, that can treat, and in some cases, can prevent people from getting, AIDS; they do not presently cure AIDS once it has infected someone). Cardinal Bertone acknowledged that the only way this would be remotely feasible, especially in Africa- where the efforts would be most needed and focused- would be through a collaborative effort involving aid groups, governments, donors, medical groups, pharmaceutical companies, and churches.[22]\n[edit] Vatican leaks\nSee also: Vatileaks\nCardinal Bertone is the main target of much of the leaks in the Roman Curia. Cardinal Bertone blamed the scandal over leaked Vatican documents on unethical journalists and a spirit of hostility toward the Catholic Church. \"Many journalists play at imitating Dan Brown,\" said Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, in an interview with the Italian magazine Famiglia Cristiana. \"They continue to invent fables or repeat legends.\" Cardinal Bertone made his remarks as Vatican judges were investigating leaks to Italian journalists of dozens of documents, including letters to the pope and encrypted cables from Vatican embassies around the world, several of which hint at power struggles among officials of the Holy See. \"The truth is that there is a malicious will to produce division\" among the collaborators of Pope Benedict XVI, he said.[23]\n[edit] Ash Wednesday speech\nOn 13 February 2013, at the last public Mass of Pope Benedict XVI before his resignation would take effect on 28 February, Cardinal Bertone praised Pope Benedict, \"We would not be honest, Your Holiness, if we said that this evening there is not a hint of sadness in our hearts. In recent years, your teaching has been a window open onto the Church and the world, which let in the rays of truth and love of God, to enlighten and warm our journey, even and especially at times when clouds gathered in the sky\". Cardinal Bertone went on to say \"All of us have realized that it is precisely the deep love that Your Holiness has for God and the Church that prompted you to make this act, revealing that purity of mind, that strong and demanding faith, that strength of humility and meekness, along with great courage, that have marked every step of your life and your ministry\".[24]\n[edit] Criticisms\n[edit] Controversial statements on child abuse within the Church\nIn his book The Case Of The Pope, Geoffrey Robertson criticises Bertone for his hyperbolic rejection of the \"demand that a bishop be obligated to contact police to denounce a priest who had admitted paedophilia\". Bertone argued that \"if a priest cannot confide in his bishop for fear of being denounced then it would mean that there is no more liberty of conscience\". As recently as Easter 2010, Bertone has publicly blamed the child sex scandal on homosexual infiltration of the clergy.\n[edit] Political controversies in the Roman Curia\nBertone has been criticized by Catholic journalist Sandro Magister for having exposed Benedict XVI to public controversies surrounding episcopal nominations in Italy and Poland.[25] Magister also writes that the problems in communications and governance that were visible during the Williamson affair can largely be attributed to Bertone.[26]\n[edit] Third Secret of Fatima controversy\nMain article: Third Secret of Fatima controversy\nBertone has been accused of lying about the content of the Third Secret of Fatima in his book, The Last Secret of Fatima,[27] and also in televised appearances.[28][29] After Bertone's book was published, Italian journalist Antonio Socci published an article entitled, Dear Cardinal Bertone: Who\u2014between you and me\u2014is Deliberately Lying?.[28] Catholic attorney Christopher Ferrara wrote an entire book called The Secret Still Hidden (content available online) aimed at exposing and debunking the claims of Cardinal Bertone with respect to Fatima.[29] The book contains an appendix entitled, 101 Grounds for Doubting Cardinal Bertone's Account. In particular, it is claimed that Bertone engaged in a systematic deception along with Cardinal Sodano and Cardinal Ratzinger to cover-up the existence of a one-page document containing the words L\u00facia Santos said were relayed to her in a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which some believe contains information about the Apocalypse and a great apostasy.[29][30] Bertone denied that he told anything less than the full truth about Fatima in a televised appearance.[31]\n[edit] Awards and honours\nIn February 2010 President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski of Poland conferred on the cardinal the country's highest decoration for foreign nationals, the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of Poland, \"for the lofty merits acquired in the development of the collaboration between the Republic of Poland and the Holy See and for the work carried out in favor of the Church in Poland.\"\nCardinal Bertone also received the Gaudium et Spes Award at the Knights of Columbus Supreme Convention in 2007. It is the order's highest honor.[32]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Zenit.

He then went back to Egypt and was ordained to the Coptic Catholic priesthood in 1960. After being pastor for a year at Fikryak, Minya, he returned to Rome and obtained a licentiate in Theology in 1962 and in Scripture in 1964. He was Professor of Sacred Scripture in the Maadi seminary from 1964. He worked with a group of Protestant and Orthodox specialists preparing an Arabic translation of the Bible.\nHe became Bishop of Minya, Egypt in 1977, a post he held until he resigned in 2002. On 30 March 2006 he was elected Patriarch of Alexandria of the Copts, after Patriarch St\u00e9phanos II Ghattas retired from the patriarchal office in March 2006, because of age. Patriarch Antonios Naguib received ecclesiastical communion from Pope Benedict XVI on 7 April 2006.\nIn April 2010, Patriarch Antonios Naguib tended his resignation to the Holy Synod upon reaching the legal age of 75. But the Holy Synod refused the resignation and asked him to continue his duties as head of the Coptic Catholic Church.\nPope Benedict named him Relator General (recording secretary) of the October 2010 special assembly of the Synod of Bishops for the Middle East, held at the Vatican.\nNaguib was made a cardinal-bishop at the consistory of 20 November 2010, and until November 24, 2012 was the only incumbent Eastern Catholic Patriarch eligible to vote in a papal conclave. (Bechara Boutros al-Rahi Patriarch of Antioch of the Maronites became the next Eastern Catholic Patriarch eligible to vote in a papal conclave upon his elevation to the cardinalate on November 24, 2012),\nOn 13 October 2011, after attacks by the military against peaceful protesters in Cairo and reported denials of Christian building permits, Cardinal Naguib urged fraternity among Egyptians of different faiths and expressed his confidence in the country's transitional government.[1]\nIn February 2012, and after the Patriarch's health deteriorated, the oldest in the ranks of bishops, Kiryllos William, the Bishop of Asiout was assigned as assistant to the patriarch to run the church in case of incapacity by the Patrirach.

He attended Coll\u00e8ge Notre Dame de Jamhour, a Jesuit school in Lebanon. He entered the Mariamite Maronite Order on 31 July 1962 and was ordained as a priest on 3 September 1967.[1][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] From 1967 to 1975 he was responsible for the Arabic transmissions of Vatican Radio.[2] In 1975 he was awarded a Ph.D. in canon and civil law. He also studied for three years at the Lateran University in Rome.[3]\n[edit] Religious positions\nHe was consecrated as auxiliary bishop of Antioch on 12 July 1986, by Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir and on 9 June 1990, he was appointed bishop of Byblos.[4] In 2003 he was elected Secretary of the Maronite Synod, and in 2009 he was appointed President of the Lebanese Episcopal Commission for the Media.[1][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n[edit] Maronite patriarch\nAt 71, he was elected Patriarch of the Maronites on 15 March 2011,[5] after getting more than two-thirds of the votes of the 39 bishops and replacing Nasrallah Sfeir. The Mass for the inauguration of his Patriarchate took place on 25 March 2011, in Bkerk\u00e9, the see of the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate. As is customary for all Maronite Patriarchs, Patriarch al-Rahi took the additional name Boutros, that of Saint Peter, who briefly held the See of Antioch before moving to Rome to become Bishop there. On 7 March 2012, Patriarch al-Rahi was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.[6]\nPatriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rahi was created a Cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in a consistory on 24 November 2012.[7]\nOn Thursday, 31 January 2013, Cardinal Patriarch al-Rahi was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI to serve as a Member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples, and the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.[8]\n[edit] Religio-political views\nIn April 2011 Patriarch Rahi said that, for the sake of communion and love, he would work \"to establish a sincere and complete dialogue\" with Muslims \"and build together a future in common life and cooperation.\" Patriarch Rai said his predecessor \"struggled with insistence to free both the national decision-making and the land of Lebanon from all forms of tutelage and occupation, worked for reconciliation in Mount Lebanon and realized needed church reforms. All of these constitute an extension of the church's springtime started by the Second Vatican Council.\"[9]\nIn September 2011, Patriarch Rai was rebuffed by the White House during his visit to the U.S. for his failure to stand up to Hezbollah, a terrorist group, and to the Syrian Regime, as well as giving spiritual endorsment to the terrorist organization and legitimicay to its weapons. This caused polarization among Christians in Lebanon between supporters and non-supporters of the Patriarch.[10]\nIn February 2013, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, Patriarch Rai, being a Cardinal, became a candidate to the papacy.\n[edit] Awards\nIn 2007 he received the award of the National Order of the Cedar.[3] In 2011 he was decorated with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor by the President of France Nicholas Sarkozy.[11]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b \"Bishop Bechara Rahi\".

Danneels entered the Grand Seminary of Bruges to become a priest. He was ordained on 17 August 1957 by Emiel-Jozef De Smedt, Bishop of Brugge.[1]\n[edit] Professor and pastor\nHe studied Thomistic philosophy at the Higher Institute of Philosophy in Leuven and theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. After obtaining his doctorate in theology, he taught at the Bruges seminary and at the Catholic University of Leuven.\nAs a scholar, he carried out a profound study of the liturgy. The articles he wrote for the Dictionary of the Liturgy have made him famous throughout the Catholic world. Danneels was actively involved in writing Sacrosanctum Concilium[citation needed], a document which initiated the liturgical reform of the Second Vatican Council.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn 4 November 1977, Danneels was named Bishop of Antwerp by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 18 from Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens. Danneels was promoted to the Archbishopric of Mechelen-Brussel on 19 December 1979 and thus the Primate of Belgium and the Bishop of the nation's Catholic military ordinariate.\n[edit] Cardinal\nDaneels was created a Cardinal-Priest of Santa Anastasia by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 2 February 1983.\nSince 2001, Danneels has been a part of the permanent secretariat of the episcopal synod. He is also a member of the Curial Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and of the Congregation for the Clergy. Between 1990 and 1999, he was international chairman for Pax Christi, a Catholic peace organisation. Danneels was awarded honorary doctorates by Georgetown University and the Catholic University of Tilburg. In 1996, he underwent a major heart operation.\nIn 2003, Danneel's was voted the \"most remarkable personality of the year\" by Flemish television viewers. His mother tongue in this bilingual (or trilingual) country is Dutch. But he also speaks English, French, German and Italian fluently. In 2005 he also led the funeral service of Grand Duchess Josephine Charlotte of Luxembourg.\nRegarding euthanasia, Danneels said on 13 April 2008:\n\n\"... it is a choice between two civilizations, a civilization of people who want to take control of themselves and a civilization with a god and place for superhuman elements ... it is an excrescence of a typical evolution, of a cancerous growth of consciousness that luckily woke up during Renaissance but that has taken cancerous proportions now, that broke away.\"[citation needed]\n\nHe conducted the 2008 wedding of Count Rodolphe de Limburg Stirum to Archduchess Marie-Christine of Austria, daughter of Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg.\n[edit] Concealment of child sex abuse\nPerhaps Daneels' most difficult moment came in 1998, when a court found that the Belgian Catholic Church had failed to protect the victims of a paedophile priest. Danneels voluntarily testified in court, but denied that he had known anything about the abuse. It was the first time ever that a cardinal had appeared before a secular court in Belgium.\nOn 8 April 2010, Danneels, already retired, recommended temporary silence about a sex abuse case that had involved Bishop Roger Vangheluwe in the late 1970s to 1980s.The abuse began when Vangheluwe was a priest and continued after he was made a bishop. Daneels advised the victim, a nephew of Vangheluwe, to delay a public statement until Vangheluwe had retired.[2] At another meeting Vangheluwe, in Danneels' presence, made a private apology, which the victim rejected and went public with his charges. On 23 April 2010, Bishop Vangheluwe resigned, admitting his guilt publicly. Four months later, Vangheluwe's nephew supplied tape recordings of the two meetings to two Belgian newspapers, which published them on 28 August 2010.[3] One of the two newspapers, De Standaard, described Danneels' action as \"containment, nothing more\", saying that Danneels' \"only aim is to avoid having the case made public so many years after the facts\".[3] The Belgian police then questioned Danneels with regard to the case, concerning which a priest had tried to alert him in about 1996 but had not been heeded.[3]\nSpeaking through a spokesman, Toon Osaer, Danneels explained that he had been unprepared for the meeting and that his proposal that the victim remain silent was \"an improvisation\".[4]\n[edit] Papal conclave of 2005\nUpon the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Danneels was listed as a possible successor (or papabile) although with weakened credentials due to the fact that he was an archbishop of a country where abortion, euthanasia and same-sex unions had recently been legalized and where, under his watch, church attendance and pastoral vocations have dropped to historical lows.[5][6][7]\nDanneels participated in the 2005 papal conclave, which elected Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Retirement and succession\nIn 2008, Danneels reached the mandatory age of retirement and, on 18 January 2010, he was replaced as Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels by Andr\u00e9-Mutien L\u00e9onard, \"known as one of the most 'conservative' of the prelates of the Belgian Catholic Church\".[8]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Holy See Press Office. \"Danneels Card.

He is the current Archbishop of Cologne, serving since 1989.[1] He previously served as Bishop of Berlin from 1980 to 1989, and was created a cardinal in 1983.[2] He is widely considered to be Germany's leading conservative Catholic figure.[3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and ordination\n2 Bishop\n3 Views\n\n3.1 Papacy and Magisterium\n3.2 Culture and liturgy\n\n\n4 Quotation\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and ordination\nMeisner was born in Breslau, which was then part of Germany, but is now known as Wroc\u0142aw in southwestern Poland.[6] He studied at the seminary of Erfurt from 1959 to 1962,[6] and was ordained a deacon on 8 April 1962.[7] On 22 December 1962, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Josef Freusberg, an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Fulda.[2]\nBetween 1963 and 1975, Meisner served as chaplain at St. Giles Parish in Heiligenstadt and Holy Cross Parish in Erfurt.[6] He also served as diocesan director of Caritas.[7] During his pastoral ministry, he furthered his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he received his doctorate of theology in 1969.[1]\n[edit] Bishop\nIn 1975, he was elected titular Bishop of Vina and auxiliary bishop to the Apostolic Administrator Erfurt-Meiningen. He was elected as a delegate to the Fourth Synod of Bishops at the Vatican in 1977, where he renewed a friendship with Karol Wojty\u0142a. After Cardinal Wojty\u0142a was elected Pope John Paul II, he appointed Meisner Bishop of Berlin in 1980, and proclaimed him Cardinal-Priest of S. Pudenziana in the consistory of 2 February 1983.\nIn 1988 after the death of Joseph H\u00f6ffner, Meisner was promoted to the position of Archbishop of Cologne, a post he continues to hold. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Meisner was the bishop in charge for the XX. World Youth Day in August 2005 in the archdiocese in Cologne that attracted more than one million people. As the leader of Germany's biggest and wealthiest archdiocese, the Cardinal holds a very significant moral and social position, too.\nMeisner regularly travels to the Vatican to meet Pope Benedict in private.\nOn Tuesday, 18 September 2012, Cardinal Meisner was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI as a Synod Father for the upcoming October 2012 Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops.[8]\nIn February 2013 Cardinal Meisner has approved the use of some morning-after pills for rape victims after he announced they did not induce abortions and could be used in Catholic hospitals. He altered his policy after two Catholic hospitals refused to treat a rape victim because they could not prescribe the pill. The Catholic Church firmly opposes abortion and artificial birth control. Many Catholics see all emergency contraceptives as abortion-inducing drugs banned by this policy, but Meisner said some prevent fertilization and could be used in rape cases. \"The German Bishops' Conference is holding a regular meeting in two weeks and the issue will certainly be on the agenda,\" Cologne archdiocese spokeswoman Nele Harbeke said.[9] [10]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Papacy and Magisterium\nMeisner is known for his support to the Pope and the Church's teachings. Pope John Paul asked for Cardinal Meisner to see him when he was in the Gemelli Hospital in Rome. Meisner had a very close relationship to Pope John Paul II and is a long time friend of Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI.\nHe said of Pope Benedict \"He [Pope Benedict] has the intelligence of 12 professors and is as pious as a child on the day of his first communion.\"[11]\n[edit] Culture and liturgy\n\"Wherever culture is separated from the worship of God, cult atrophies in ritualism and culture becomes degenerate\", said Meisner at the blessing of his own archdiocese's new art museum, the Kolumba, on 14 September 2007. His choice of words recalled the phrase \"entartete Kunst\" (\"degenerate art\") used as the title of the exhibition opened by Adolf Hitler in Munich on 19 July 1937 and provoked strong negative reaction.[12]\nIt was widely recognized that Meisner was venting his anger about the stained-glass window in Cologne Cathedral by Gerhard Richter, which was revealed just weeks before and of which he disapproved.[13][14][15]\n[edit] Quotation\n\n\"We as Catholic Christians do always have a reason for hope.

Before his appointment as Los Angeles archbishop, he served as Auxiliary Bishop of Fresno from 1975\u20131980 and as Bishop of Stockton from 1980\u20131985.\nBorn in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles and raised in the city's San Fernando Valley area, Mahony was ordained to the priesthood in the Diocese of Monterey-Fresno in 1962. He was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Fresno in January 1975 and consecrated bishop in March 1975. He was then appointed Bishop of Stockton in 1980. In 1985, Mahony was appointed Archbishop of Los Angeles by Pope John Paul II, and became the first Los Angeles native to hold the office. He was made a cardinal in 1991.\nDuring his tenure as Los Angeles archbishop, Mahony was instrumental in dividing the archdiocese into five administrative subdivisions, and oversaw the controversial construction of the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which opened in September 2002. He has also been an instrumental figure in the Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal. As a cardinal, Mahony voted in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. He reached the mandatory retirement age for bishops in 2011 and was succeeded by his coadjutor, now current Metropolitan Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Horacio G\u00f3mez on March 1, 2011.[1]\nOn January 31, 2013, Archbishop G\u00f3mez officially relieved Mahony of all of his public and episcopal duties in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles following the release of personnel files documenting priest sexual abuse cases during Mahony's tenure.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and priesthood\n2 Episcopal career\n\n2.1 Civic involvement\n2.2 Controversies\n\n2.2.1 Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels\n2.2.2 Pastoral Letter\n2.2.3 Vocations\n\n\n2.3 Sexual abuse cases\n2.4 Retirement\n\n\n3 Episcopal succession\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and priesthood\nRoger Michael Mahony was born in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles, California, the son of Victor and Loretta (n\u00e9e Baron) Mahony. He has a twin brother, Louis, and an older brother, Neil. As a child he attended St. Charles Borromeo Grammar School in North Hollywood and at age 14, he entered Los Angeles College, the junior seminary of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\nAfter studying at the Our Lady Queen of Angels Seminary and St. John's Seminary, Mahony was ordained to the priesthood on May 1, 1962, by the Bishop of Monterey-Fresno, Aloysius Joseph Willinger, CSsR. He graduated from The Catholic University of America in 1964 with a master's degree in social work. For the next 13 years, he held pastoral and curial assignments in the Diocese of Monterey-Fresno and the newly formed Diocese of Fresno. He was named a monsignor in February 1967, and also taught social work at Fresno State University during this period.\n[edit] Episcopal career\n\n\nStyles of\nRoger Mahony\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nLos Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Roger Mahony, as found on the cathedra in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, Los Angeles\n\n\nOn January 7, 1975, he was appointed auxiliary bishop of Fresno and titular bishop of Tamascani. Mahony received his episcopal consecration on the following March 19 from the Bishop of Fresno, Hugh Donohue, with Bishops William Johnson and John Cummins serving as co-consecrators. That year, the Governor, Jerry Brown, appointed Mahony the first chair of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board, where he worked with the United Farm Workers and various growers in the state to resolve agricultural labor disputes.\nOn February 15, 1980, Mahony was appointed Bishop of Stockton by Pope John Paul II, as announced by the nuncio, Jean Jadot. Mahony terminated two extern priests for sexual abuse during his tenure at Stockton. On July 16, 1985, Mahony was promoted to Archbishop of Los Angeles, the first native Angeleno to hold the office. Mahony was created Cardinal-Priest of Santi Quattro Coronati by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of June 28, 1991.\nAfter the former Cathedral of Saint Vibiana was damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Mahony began plans to construct the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, one of the largest Catholic churches in the United States. It was dedicated on September 2, 2002. Mahony was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Mahony with Rep. Diane Watson (D-CA)\n\n\n[edit] Civic involvement\nMahony was a member of the Board of Trustees of The Catholic University of America. He served on a number of committees of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, including those on Liturgy, Pro-Life Activities, and Migration & Refugees. He is still a consultant for the latter two committees. In the Vatican, he was a member of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace (1984\u20131989) and the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants (1986\u20131991). He remains a member of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications (1989\u2013present), Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See (2000\u2013present), and Congregation for Eastern Churches.\nMahony spoke out on provisions in immigration bills, such as the Sensenbrenner-King Bill, debated by Congress in late 2005 and 2006. He wrote to President Bush[2] that certain proposed measures would effectively outlaw the provision of charitable assistance and religious ministry to individuals not in valid immigration status. On Ash Wednesday, 2006, Mahony announced that he would order the clergy and laity of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to ignore H.R. 4437 if it were to become law.[3] He personally lobbied senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein to have the Senate consider a comprehensive immigration reform bill, rather than the enforcement-only bill that passed the House of Representatives.[4] Mahony also blamed the Congress for the illegal immigration crisis due to their failure to act on the issue in the previous 20 years, opposed H.R. 4437 as punitive and open to abusive interpretation, and supported S. 2611.[5][6]\n[edit] Controversies\n[edit] Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels\nMany Catholics were upset about the non-traditional design and the amount of money that was spent on the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. Mahony defended the expense of the new cathedral to replace the previous earthquake-damaged cathedral citing the need for a community to have a religious center that unites people in faith and spirituality. Today, the new Cathedral averages one million visitors each year.[7][8]\n[edit] Pastoral Letter\nTo prepare for the new Millennium, Mahony wrote a Pastoral Letter on the Mass entitled \"Gather Faithfully Together: A Guide for Sunday Mass\".[9] The Letter called all parishes to plan and celebrate each Sunday Mass in order to deepen the faith-life of all Catholics through the Eucharist.[10] Some, including televangelist Mother Angelica, found \"Gather Faithfully Together\" to be gravely inconsistent with existing official liturgical directives set by the Catholic Church.[11] Others, however, found the letter to be visionary, inviting the Church to a more fruitful celebration of the Eucharist.[12]\n[edit] Vocations\nThe number of priestly vocations declined under Mahony's leadership.[13] By contrast, lay ministries grew and Mahony has said that \"What some refer to as a 'vocations crisis' is, rather, one of the many fruits of the Second Vatican Council. It is a sign of God's deep love for the Church, and an invitation to a more creative and effective ordering of gifts and energy in the Body of Christ.\"[14]\n[edit] Sexual abuse cases\nMain article: Sexual abuse scandal in Los Angeles archdiocese\nOn July 16, 2007, Mahony and the Roman Catholic Church in Los Angeles apologized for abuses by priests after 508 victims reached a record-breaking settlement worth $660 million, with an average of $1.3 million for each plaintiff. Mahony described the abuse as a \"terrible sin and crime\", after a series of trials into sex abuse claims since the 1940s were to begin. The agreement settled all outstanding civil lawsuits against the Archdiocese. The deal dwarfs the $157 million settlement paid by the Archdiocese of Boston since Massachusetts law places a legal dollar cap on how much money a non-profit group can be required to pay.[15]\nThe 2006 documentary Deliver Us From Evil chronicles accusations that Mahony knew that a priest serving under him, Oliver O'Grady, a native of the Republic of Ireland, had a two decade history of sexually abusing and molesting children (including one infant) but failed to keep him away from children. The film claims that in 1984, a Stockton police investigation into sexual abuse allegations against O'Grady was reportedly closed after diocesan officials promised to remove the priest from any contact with children. Instead, Mahony reassigned O'Grady to a parish approximately 50 miles (80\u00a0km) east, in San Andreas, where O'Grady continued to molest and rape children. Not long after, Mahony was promoted from bishop of Stockton to archbishop of Los Angeles. By 2012, local authorities had obtained internal Church documents showing Mahony had organized the movement of sexual predators across jurisdictional boundaries to complicate any possible prosecution. In 1987 he prohibited a priest from seeking therapy for his urges on the grounds that a therapist might report the crimes to the police.[16]\nIn January 2013 The New York Times editorialized: \"No member of the Roman Catholic hierarchy fought longer and more energetically than Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles to conceal the decades-long scandal involving the rape and intimidation of children by rogue priests. For years, the cardinal withheld seamy church records from parents, victims and the public, brandishing endless litigation and fatuous claims of confidentiality.\"[17]\n[edit] Retirement\nOn April 6, 2010, with Mahony due to reach his mandatory retirement age of 75 the following year, the Vatican under Pope Benedict XVI named San Antonio archbishop Jos\u00e9 Horacio G\u00f3mez as the Coadjutor Archbishop of Los Angeles with immediate right of succession to Mahony.[18] G\u00f3mez succeeded Mahony on February 28, 2011 after the ceremony of transition held at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, with his resignation taking canonical effect on March 1, 2011.[19] G\u00f3mez is the highest ranked Mexican born prelate within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.[20]\nIn his retirement, Mahony intends to devote more time to advocacy on behalf of immigrants, an issue that he has supported for many years.[21] He resides at his childhood parish in North Hollywood, and is eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on February 27, 2016.\nOn January 31, 2013, Archbishop G\u00f3mez relieved Mahony of all of his remaining public and administrative duties, over Mahony's handling of sexual abuse cases during the 1980s.[22][23] G\u00f3mez's announcement came in the wake of a court order requiring the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to release its unredacted files on clergy sexual abuse. According to the archdiocese, Mahony remains \"a priest in good standing\" and may still celebrate Mass, but he may no longer speak publicly[24] or exercise any responsibilities ordinarily reserved for a bishop, such as administering the sacrament of Confirmation.[22] He still holds the titles of Cardinal and Archbishop Emeritus of Los Angeles,[22] and retains his Vatican appointments including his eligibility to vote in papal conclaves.[25] Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, a number of Catholic groups voiced opposition to Mahony's voting in a papal conclave so soon after his censure; however, Mahony has publicly stated his intention to participate in the conclave.[26][27]\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nHugh Aloysius Donohoe\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nGeorge Patrick Ziemann\nFebruary 23, 1987\n\n\nArmando Xavier Ochoa\nFebruary 23, 1987\n\n\nCarl Anthony Fisher\nFebruary 23, 1987\n\n\nSylvester Donovan Ryan\nMay 31, 1990\n\n\nStephen Edward Blaire\nMay 31, 1990\n\n\nJoseph Martin Sartoris\nMarch 19, 1994\n\n\nThomas John Curry\nMarch 19, 1994\n\n\nGabino Zavala\nMarch 19, 1994\n\n\nGeorge Hugh Niederauer\nJanuary 25, 1995\n\n\nGerald Eugene Wilkerson\nJanuary 21, 1998\n\n\nEdward William Clark\nMarch 26, 2001\n\n\nOscar Azarcon Solis\nFebruary 10, 2004\n\n\nAlexander Salazar\nNovember 4, 2004\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Cardinal Roger Mahony passes leadership of L.A.

He was ordained a priest on 2 August 1964 by Bishop Jose Maximino Dominguez-Rodriguez of Matanzas. He was assigned to various parishes in the Diocese of Matanzas from 1964 to 1966. He was imprisoned by the Communist government from 1966 to 1967. From 1967-1969, pastor of Jag\u00fcey Grande, his native city; as all the pastors in Cuba, due to a severe shortage of priests in those years, he served in several parishes and churches at the same time. Pastor of the cathedral of Matanzas, and at the same time, assisted the parish of Pueblo Nuevo and two other churches in the countryside; he was also president of the Diocesan Commission of Catechetic and realized an active apostolate with the youth of the diocese; in those years, which were even more difficult for the pastoral work of the church, he began a youth movement that included, among other forms of apostolate, a summer camp for the youth, and a work of evangelization through theatrical works performed by the same youth. At the same time, he was professor at San Carlos y San Ambrosio Interdiocesan Seminary, Havana, where he traveled every week to teach moral theology for several years.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn December 4, 1978, Pope John Paul II named him Bishop of the Diocese of Pinar del Rio. He was consecrated bishop on January 14, 1979 by Mons. Mario Tagliaferri, Titular Archbishop of Formia, Pro-Nuncio in Cuba and assisted by Mons. Francisco Oves-Fernandez, Archbishop of Havana and Mons. Dom\u00ednguez-Rodr\u00edguez, Bishop of Matanzas. His episcopal motto is Sufficit tibi gratia mea. He was later promoted to Archbishop of Havana in 1981. He was proclaimed Cardinal-Priest of Santi Aquila e Priscilla on 26 November 1994. He served as president of the Conference of Catholic Bishops of Cuba from 1988 to 1999. In 1996, he presided the commission for the process of postulation of the cause of beatification of the Servant of God Fr. F\u00e9lix Varela y Morales. Cardinal Ortega y Alamino was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Awards\nIn 2004, the Humanitarian Institution of Merit in Barcelona, Spain awarded him with the \"Gran Cruz al M\u00e9rito Humanitario.\" He has been given an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Saint Thomas, Barry University, University of San Francisco, Providence College, Boston College, St. John's University and Universidad Popular Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de Puebla\n[edit] Views\nOrtega y Alamino has been critical of both capitalism and communism. Like John Paul II, he has urged his nation not to construct a post-communist future on the basis of hyper-capitalist principles. In 1998, he warned of the insidious influence in Cuba of a \"species of American subculture that invades everything: It is a fashion, a conception of life.\"[1] In September 1993 the Cuban Conference of Catholic Bishops, headed by Cardenal Ortega, published the message \"El amor todo lo espera\" (Love endures all things), extremely critical of the Cuban Communist government and asking for a new direction of the country. In April 2010 he said that Cuba was in crisis.[2]\n[edit] Political activism\nOrtega y Alamino is the head of the Cuban bishops' conference.[3] On May 20, 2010, Archbishop Dionisio Guillermo Garc\u00eda Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and Cardinal Ortega met with Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro to discuss issues concerning jailed political dissidents.[3][4][5] While the rare four hour meeting was potentially seen as being hopeful, Ortega y Alamino said that there \"will be a process and this process has to start with small steps and these steps will be made.\"[3] While the Curia has called for meetings and concessions on these issues before, press conferences to discuss high level meetings like this had not been done so quickly thereafter.[3][4][5]\n[edit] External links\n\nHavana puts on New Face for Pope by Phillip True, Express News, January 21, 1998\n\n[edit] Sources\n\nEmil Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino at Catholic-Hierarchy.

John Paul II appointed him a Cardinal-Priest of Nostra Signora del SS. Sacramento e Santi Martiri Canadesi on February 28, 1994. From 1997 to 2000 he was president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops. Turcotte has participated in the 1993, 1997, 2000, and 2002 World Youth Days.\nTurcotte is known for his work with the poor and writes a weekly religion column in the Sunday edition of the Journal de Montr\u00e9al. In 1997, he gave his opinion about Quebec being a distinct society.[1]\nHe was a voting member (cardinal elector) of the College of Cardinals in the 2005 papal conclave. Margaret Hebblethwaite, co-author of the book The Next Pope, identified him as papabile. Other books and the BBC also identified him as a long-shot possibility for Pope.\nDaniel Cere, head of the Newman Centre at McGill University, told The Toronto Star that Turcotte \"is very much a pastoral figure, much like John Paul II.\"[citation needed] A Toronto priest told the newspaper he was \"your man if you want a pastoral bon vivant Pope John XXIII figure.\"[citation needed] John Allen wrote in the 2002 book Conclave that Turcotte was seen as a \"diamond in the rough, a potentially magnificent leader who is still finding his way.\"[citation needed] His lack of proficiency in the Italian language, as well as his lack of international experience, were seen as shortcomings. Turcotte is eligible to participate and vote in any future conclaves before his 80th birthday on 26 June 2016.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Abortion\nIn 2007, Turcotte presided over the funeral of Supreme Court judge Antonio Lamer, who controversially decided to remove all restrictions to abortion in Tremblay v. Daigle in 1989. At the funeral, Turcotte praised Lamer as \u201ca giant of the law\u201d and a man \u201cwho worked a great deal for justice\u201d.[2] He was not, however, directly addressing the subject of abortion when he spoke those words.\nOn September 11, 2008, Turcotte returned his Order of Canada (appointed in 1996) insignia in protest of the induction of pro-choice activist Henry Morgentaler on July 1, 2008. The return of his insignia happened later than that of others who had protested against Morgentaler's entry because Turcotte had hoped that the Consultative Council for the Order of Canada would revise its decision. Eventually, fearing that his silence on the matter might be misinterpreted, Turcotte renounced his title Officer of the Order of Canada and returned his insignia.[3] This became effective on June 1, 2009.[4]\nIn 2009, Turcotte said in an interview that \"I can understand that in certain cases, there is almost no other choice than to practice (abortion)\", which was seen as controversial in light of his previous condemnation of Morgentaler.[5]\n[edit] Political ties\nIn 2004, he criticized statements by former minister Sheila Copps about Turcotte's relationship with Pierre Trudeau.[6] He had been present at the state funeral of the former PM.\n[edit] Women's ordination\nTurcotte refused to accept the ordination of women after a local synod proposed the idea.[7]\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nPaul Gr\u00e9goire\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nVital Mass\u00e9 (Titular Giru Marcelli, Auxiliary Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me)\nDecember 8, 1993\n\n\nNeil E.

His mother died when he was three-years-old, and his father then remarried. He attended the minor seminary in Zagreb; a local Trappist monk sold his motorbike to help Vinko's father afford board. He then studied philosophy and theology at the major seminary of \u0110akovo.\n[edit] Priesthood\nPulji\u0107 was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Stjepan Bauerlein on June 29, 1970, and then served as a chaplain in the Diocese of Banja Luka until 1973, whence he became an official of the diocesan curia. He was a parish priest in Sasina from June to November 1973, and in Ravska from 1973 to 1978. In 1978, he was named spiritual director of the minor seminary of Zadar. During this time, he also served as a confessor at a Benedictine monastery and organized spiritual retreats for priests, seminarians, and women religious.\nIn 1987, he returned to the Diocese of Banja Luka, where he served as a parish priest in Gradi\u0161ka. He was later transferred to Sarajevo in 1990 as vice-rector of its major seminary.\n[edit] Episcopal career\nOn November 19, 1990, Pulji\u0107 was appointed the sixth Archbishop of Vrhbosna by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on January 6, 1991 from John Paul II himself, with Archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Justin Francis Rigali serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter's Basilica.\nFollowing the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, Pulji\u0107 became involved in helping the thousands of refugees and exiles and advocated human rights.\nPulji\u0107 was created Cardinal Priest of S. Chiara a Vigna Clara by John Paul II in the consistory of November 26, 1994. On October 18, 2001, he was invested as bailiff of the Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion in the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Pulji\u0107 was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XVI. He served as President of the Bishops' Conference of Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1995 to 2002, and again from 2005 to the present. On Tuesday, September 18, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named him as a Synod Father of the upcoming October 2012 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops.[1]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Role during the Bosnian conflict\nDuring the war, he frequently risked his life while making pastoral trips to his parishes; he was imprisoned during one visit for twelve hours by the Serbian military in Ilija\u0161, running a serious risk when he rode in a United Nations Protection Force tank to Vare\u0161. John Paul II once said to him, \"When I imposed hands on you...to consecrate you in the office of Pastor of the Church of Sarajevo, I had no idea that very shortly your cross would be so heavy and your cup so bitter.\"\n[edit] Status of Medjugorje\nCardinal Vinko Puljic of Sarajevo, speaking at the 2004 assembly of the Synod of Bishops, complained that the reported apparitions of Medjugorje were becoming a source of division in the Church,[2] and was involved in setting up in 2006 of a commission to examine the alleged Marian apparitions.[3]\n[edit] Relations with Muslims\nCardinal Pulji\u0107 has said that before the war, relations with Muslims were very good, but that in recent times, the situation has somewhat deteriorated. The first sign was the arrival of humanitarian aid from Arab countries\u00a0: it was distributed only to Muslims, while at the same time it was prohibited to give it to Christians.[4]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Nomina di Padri sinodali della XIII Assemblea Generale Ordinaria del Sinodo dei Vescovi (7-28 ottobre 2012) [Appointment of Fathers of the XIII Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops (October 7-28, 2012)]\" (in Italian).

He was ordained a priest in Rome in 1957.\nIn 1961, he returned to Mexico and was assigned to the seminary in Guadalajara, Jalisco, where he worked first as a teacher and then as rector.\nIn 1988 Sandoval was named Coadjutor bishop of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, and succeeded as its bishop in 1992. He was invested as Archbishop of Guadalajara in April 1994, replacing the murdered former incumbent, Cardinal Juan Jes\u00fas Posadas Ocampo,and later that year he was named a cardinal.\nHe was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Sandoval has also made regular appearances on the Mexican Catholic network \"Mariavisi\u00f3n\", which is based in Guadalajara, normally by teaching the catechism during short episodes between regular programming.\nOn 7 December 2011 his retirement was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI; Cardinal Francisco Robles Ortega was appointed his successor .\n[edit] Political controversy\nSandoval has intervened in political issues at the national level. He was at the centre of the macrolimosna controversy in 2008, which involved a donation to the Catholic Church by the governor of Jalisco from public funds. He has also been under investigation by SIEDO (Subprocuradur\u00eda de Investigaci\u00f3n Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada), or the special office for investigating organized crime, which specializes in economic crimes, for possible money laundering. The investigation did not lead to any prosecution.\nHe has organized opposition to the use of condoms, sex education, emergency contraceptive pills. In August 2010 he entered the debate on the legalisation of gay marriage in Mexico by accusing justices of the Mexican Supreme Court of having accepted bribes from the PRD(Democratic Revolution Party) and the PRD mayor of Mexico City, Marcelo Ebrard, to uphold the Mexico City statute that legalises both gay marriage and gay adoption of children. Ebrard filed suit against him in the civil courts in Mexico City for defamation[1] after Sandoval refused to retract his comments.\nHe has made several controversial statements. He has said, \"To be a protestant, one cannot have any shame\"; and on women rape victims he has been quoted as saying: \"Women should not go around being so provocative; because of this there are so many rapes.\" He has been criticised by gay rights groups for using the term \"maric\u00f3n\" (Spanish equal to \"fag\") to describe homosexuals, which is regarded as insulting.[2]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=37892\n^ http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/08/23/mexican-gay-rights-activists-and-catholic-protestors-clash\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nArchdiocese of Guadalajara\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 161701411\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nSandoval Iniguez, Juan\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n28 March 1933\n\n\nPlace of birth\nYahualica, Jalisco, M\u00e9xico\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6273/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 32534/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 31164/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 10114/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1466422-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130227224555 ", "Name": "Juan Sandoval \u00cd\u00f1iguez"}, {"url": "/wiki/Antonio_Mar%C3%ADa_Rouco_Varela", "FullText": "This name uses Spanish naming customs; the first or paternal family name is Rouco\u00a0and the second or maternal family name is Varela.\n\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Antonio Rouco Varela\n\n\nArchbishop of Madrid\n\n\n\n\n\nArchdiocese\nMadrid\n\n\nAppointed\n28 July 1994\n\n\nPredecessor\nAngel Suqu\u00eda Goicoechea\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of San Lorenzo in Damaso\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nOrdination\n28 March 1959\nby\u00a0Angel Suqu\u00eda Goicoechea\n\n\nConsecration\n31 October 1976\nby\u00a0Maximino Romero de Lema\n\n\nCreated Cardinal\n21 February 1998\n\n\nRank\nCardinal Priest\n\n\nPersonal details\n\n\nBirth name\nAntonio Mar\u00eda Rouco Varela\n\n\nBorn\n(1936-08-24) August 24, 1936 (age\u00a076)\nVilalba, Galicia, Spanish Republic\n\n\nNationality\nSpanish\n\n\nDenomination\nRoman Catholicism\n\n\nParents\n\n\n\nVicente Rouco\nMar\u00eda Eugenia Varela\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\n\nAuxiliary Bishop of Santiago de Compostela (1976-1984)\nTitular Bishop of Gergis (1976-1984)\nArchbishop of Santiago de Compostela (1984-1994)\n\n\n\n\n\nMotto\nin ecclesiae communione\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\n\n\n\nStyles of\nAntonio Rouco Varela\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nMadrid\n\n\nAntonio Mar\u00eda Rouco Varela (born 24 August 1936) is a Spanish prelate of the Roman Catholic Church.

He is Archbishop Emeritus of Milan, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1998. Previous to his service in Milan, Tettamanzi was Archbishop of Genoa.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early years\n1.2 Bishop\n\n\n2 Social teaching\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Biography\n[edit] Early years\nTettamanzi was born in Renate, then in the province of Milan (now in the province of Monza and Brianza).\nHe was educated at the Minor Seminary of Seveso and the Seminary of Venegono Inferiore and finally at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome where he earned a doctorate in theology.\nAfter studying in local seminaries, he was ordained a priest on 28 June 1957 by Archbishop Giovanni Battista Montini (the future Pope Paul VI). He served in the Archdiocese of Milan as a pastor and faculty member of the Minor Seminary of Masnago and of Seveso San Pietro from 1960 until 1966. As well as a faculty member of the Seminary of Venegono from 1966 to 1986.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn 1 July 1989 when Pope John Paul II named Tettamanzi archbishop of Ancona-Osimo, he received his episcopal consecration from Jesuit Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini at the cathedral on the following 23 September. Upon being chosen Secretary-General and Vice President of the Italian Episcopal Conference, Tettamanzi submitted his resignation as bishop on 6 April 1991.\nJohn Paul II called Tettamanzi back into active ministry by appointing him to the Archdiocese of Genoa. He was appointed its archbishop on 20 April 1995, and in the consistory of 21 February 1998, Tettamanzi was created Cardinal-Priest of Ss. Ambrogio e Carlo. Upon the announced retirement of Cardinal Martini, Tettamanzi was reassigned as archbishop of Milan on 11 July 2002.\nWith the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II came intense speculation as to his successor. Tettamanzi's position as head of an archdiocese that was historically seen as a step towards the papacy (and considered one of the wealthiest and most powerful of Italian dioceses), as well as his charisma and popularity among the people, placed him in the view of the Italian press as one of the overall favorites to become John Paul II's successor. He himself seemed to count on success, arranging an elaborate photo-call on his departure from the diocese for the conclave. The press presented him as one of the leading Italian candidates, but the Italian cardinals are now a minority in the college. Moreover, Tettamanzi's less than imposing figure did not impress on an international level. There were reports that he never got more than two votes in the ballots. The choice in fact fell on far better known German Cardinal Ratzinger, who become Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Tettamanzi remains eligible to vote in any future conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on 14 March 2014.\nTettamanzi is said to speak only Italian, which would be a disadvantage in a time when national leaders, and especially popes, are sometimes required to master foreign languages. He is accordingly little known outside his own country.\nIn response to the motu proprio, Summorum Pontificum of Pope Benedict, Cardinal Tettamanzi controversially stated that the document did not apply to the northern Italian archdiocese since it uses the Ambrosian Rite rather than the Roman one[1].\nOn 20 March 2008, Tettamanzi issued the New Ambrosian Rite Lectionary, previously confirmed by the Holy See, that supersedes the 1976 experimental edition.\nIn March 2009, following canon 401 of Canon Law,[2] he offered to resign from his post as archbishop of Milan; Pope Benedict XVI did not accept the resignation at that time and it was believed that Tettamanzi would not leave his post in the next two years.[3] Pope Benedict accepted Cardinal Tettamanzi's resignation on the 54th anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood and appointed Angelo Scola, until then Cardinal Patriarch of Venice, as his successor. After his resignation from the post of archbishop Tettamanzi lives in Triuggio, his 101 years old mother died in early February 2012.[4][5] In July 2012 he was named apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Vigevano\n[edit] Social teaching\nCardinal Tettamanzi has declared that the goal of a company is not only to create a profit for the shareholders but that the company has to be a community of women and men that work together to satisfy the needs of the people involved in the company. He also affirmed that a person needs to have stability in his work in order to be able to plan his life. In his speech to the Diocese, in the day of St. Ambrose 2008, he said that Muslims have the right to build their mosque in cities of mainly Catholic countries.[6] In his speech to the city on St Ambrose of 2010 he reaffirmed that not all the immigrants in Italy are criminals.[7]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Vatican to clarify motu proprio soon\".

He currently serves as the Archbishop of Vienna and President of the Austrian Bishops Conference. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1998. He is also the chaplain of the Order of the Golden Fleece (Austrian branch), of which he has been a member since 1961. He is a member of the formerly sovereign princely House of Sch\u00f6nborn. He is seen as a leading candidate for the papacy because he is conservative, albeit a \"balanced reformer\" who is well liked by all factions of the church[1] and noted for his tolerant views.[2] Sch\u00f6nborn has travelled widely and is well known in the Catholic Church globally for editing the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He is a former student of Pope Benedict XVI and a close confidant, ally and long-time friend.[1] He has German Bohemian, Czech, Austrian and Irish ancestry, has studied in France and been a Professor for several years in Switzerland, and speaks six languages.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Family and early life\n2 Early church career\n3 Archbishop of Vienna\n\n3.1 Response to sex abuse\n\n\n4 Views\n\n4.1 Islam and Catholicism\n4.2 Catholic-Orthodox dialogue\n4.3 HIV/AIDS and condoms\n4.4 Mozart, Catholicism and Freemasonry\n4.5 Evolution and the Catholic Church\n\n\n5 Coat of arms\n6 Ancestry\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Family and early life\nMain article: House of Sch\u00f6nborn\n\n\n\n\nHis birthplace and ancestral castle, Skalka Castle in modern Vlastislav\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLady Selina Meade (1797\u20131872), married Countess of Clam-Martinic, painted by Thomas Lawrence\n\n\nChristoph Maria Michael Hugo Damian Peter Adalbert Graf von Sch\u00f6nborn was born at Skalka Castle, west of Litom\u011b\u0159ice, Bohemia in Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic), the second son of the Count Maria Hugo Damian Adalbert Josef Hubertus von Sch\u00f6nborn and Baroness Eleonore Ottilie Hilda Maria von Doblhoff. He is a member of the House of Sch\u00f6nborn and descends from some of the leading aristostratic families of Bohemia and other lands of the Habsburg Empire of both German Bohemian, Czech Bohemian and German Austrian origin, including Lobkowicz, Chotek, Wurmbrand-Stuppach and Clam-Martinic. The counts of Sch\u00f6nborn became lords of the lordship of Skalken in Bohemia in 1796 and were owners of the lordship until a land reform in 1923. The Sch\u00f6nborn family continued to live in the local castle until 1945. His family spoke German as their primary language and Czech as a secondary language; in Skalken around half of the population were native German speakers and the other half native Czech speakers and most people spoke both languages. During the war, his father Hugo Damian was involved in the anti-Nazi resistance. After 1945, Bohemia's large German-speaking population (especially the nobility) was persecuted by the new communist rulers, and the family fled to Austria when Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn was nine months old.[3] His parents divorced in 1959. He has two brothers and one sister. Several members of the Sch\u00f6nborn family held high offices in the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire from the 17th century, including several prince-bishops, cardinals and ecclesiastical prince-electors.[4] His legal birth name is Christoph (Maria Michael Hugo Damian Peter Adalbert) Graf von Sch\u00f6nborn, the name under which he is still often referred to, while Austrian authorities registered him under the name \"Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn.\" Despite growing up in Vienna, he has said that Bohemia is his home.[3]\nChristoph Sch\u00f6nborn also descends from the astronomers Joseph Johann Littrow and Karl L. Littrow, and the feminist pioneer Auguste von Littrow. He also has an Irish great-great-great-grandmother, Lady Selina Meade (1797\u20131872), the daughter of Richard Meade, 2nd Earl of Clanwilliam (1766\u20131805), married Countess of Clam-Martinic. Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn is a relative of Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg.\nIn addition to his native German, he is fluent in French, Italian, English, Spanish and Latin.[5] He lived for several years in France and French-speaking Switzerland, and speaks French at a near-native level.\n[edit] Early church career\nIn September 1945, his family was forced to flee from Bohemia. Sch\u00f6nborn took his Matura examination in 1963, and entered the Order of Preachers. He studied theology in Paris; and philosophy and psychology in Bornheim-Walberberg and Vienna. Sch\u00f6nborn also attended the Catholic Institute of Paris for further theological work, before studying Slavic and Byzantine Christianity at the Sorbonne.\nHe was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Franz K\u00f6nig on 27 December 1970 in Vienna. Sch\u00f6nborn obtained a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1971, and later studied in Regensburg under Fr. Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI). He subsequently completed a doctorate in Sacred Theology in Paris. From 1975 he was Professor of Dogmatics at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. In 1980, he became a member of the International Theological Commission of the Holy See, and in 1987 he became editorial secretary for the Catechism of the Catholic Church. In 1991 he was chosen to become an auxiliary bishop of Vienna.\n[edit] Archbishop of Vienna\nHe was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Vienna on 11 April 1995 and succeeded as Archbishop of Vienna on 14 September 1995. He was created Cardinal-Priest of Ges\u00f9 Divin Lavoratore by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 1998. Considered among the papabili following John Paul's death, Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn remains eligible to vote in any future papal conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on 22 January 2025.\nHe serves as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, that for the Oriental Churches, and that for Catholic Education, and of the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church. On 5 January 2011 he was appointed among the first members of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.[6]\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Sch\u00f6rnborn (with crosier) walking in the Otto von Habsburg funeral procession\n\n\nCardinal Sch\u00f6nborn also serves as the chaplain to the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece. Sch\u00f6nborn's episcopal motto is Vos autem dixi amicos (I have called you friends) from John 15:15.\nCardinal Sch\u00f6nborn presided over the requiem for Otto of Habsburg, former Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, in St. Stephen's Cathedral on 16 July 2011.[7]\nOn Tuesday, 18 September 2012, Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn was named by Pope Benedict XVI as a Synod Father for the upcoming October 2012 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization.[8]\nHe is the highest-ranked Catholic Church official to visit Iran after the 1980\u201388 Iran-Iraq War.[9]\nHe has been described as an accomplished crisis manager.[10]\n[edit] Response to sex abuse\nIn May 2010 Sch\u00f6nborn told the Austrian Catholic news agency Kathpress, \"the days of cover-up are over. For a long while the Church's principle of forgiveness was falsely interpreted and was in favour of those responsible and not the victims,\" while praising Pope Benedict XVI for having pushed for sex abuse inquiries when he was a Cardinal. Sch\u00f6nborn has earned much recognition[11] for his handling of the abuse scandal surrounding former Vienna Archbishop Hans Hermann Gro\u00ebr, who was removed from office in 1995. In 1998, Sch\u00f6nborn publicly confirmed that he believed in the allegations against Gro\u00ebr.[12] In 2010, he explained that the future Pope Benedict XVI had long pressed for a full investigation of the case, but met resistance in the Vatican at the time.[13]\n[edit] Views\nSch\u00f6nborn has been described as a \"conciliatory pragmatist who is open to dialogue.\"[14]\n[edit] Islam and Catholicism\nHe favours dialogue between Catholicism and Islam.[15]\n[edit] Catholic-Orthodox dialogue\nSch\u00f6nborn has said that theological differences between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches can be resolved, if the two faiths can overcome the burden of history.[16]\n[edit] HIV/AIDS and condoms\nIn 1996, Sch\u00f6nborn told an Austrian television audience that someone suffering from AIDS might use a condom as a \"lesser evil\", but he quickly cautioned, \"no one could affirm that the use of a condom is the ideal in sexual relations.\"[17]\n[edit] Mozart, Catholicism and Freemasonry\nAccording to Eric Leitenberger, Sch\u00f6nborn's spokesman, the cardinal's position is that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a Freemason, but that he was also fully Catholic.[18]\n[edit] Evolution and the Catholic Church\nIn an editorial in the New York Times on 7 July 2005[19] Sch\u00f6nborn accepted the possibility of evolution but criticised certain \"neo-Darwinian\" theories as incompatible with Catholic teaching:\n\nEvolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense \u2013 an unguided, unplanned process of random variation and natural selection \u2013 is not. Any system of thought that denies or seeks to explain away the overwhelming evidence for design in biology is ideology, not science.\n\nThis statement created considerable controversy, including public criticism of Sch\u00f6nborn's views by the director of the Vatican Observatory, George Coyne, SJ, who pointed out that Pope John Paul II\u2019s declaration that \u201cevolution is no longer a mere hypothesis\u201d is now \u201ca fundamental church teaching\u201d[20] and a response by Catholic physicist Stephen Barr in the Catholic periodical First Things,[21] to which Sch\u00f6nborn in turn replied.[22]\n[edit] Coat of arms\n\n\n\n\nChristoph Sch\u00f6nborn's coat of arms as a cardinal and archbishop.

He is the current Archbishop of Mexico City and the current Primate Archbishop of Mexico, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1998.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and ministry\n2 Episcopal career and cardinalate\n3 Episcopal Succession\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and ministry\nNorberto Rivera Carrera was born in La Pur\u00edsima, a small town outside Tepehuanes, to Ram\u00f3n Rivera Ch\u00e1idez and Soledad Carrera; he has a sister who is a nun. His father immigrated to and worked in the United States in order to support the family. Rivera entered the seminary of Durango in 1955. He later went to Rome to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University, from where he obtained his licentiate in theology. He was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Paul VI on July 3, 1966.\nFrom 1967 to 1985, Rivera did pastoral work in Durango and Zacatecas, as well as serving as a professor of dogmatic theology and the prefect of discipline at the Durango seminary. He also directed Social Communications for the Archdiocese of Durango, was the diocesan advisor to the Christian Family Movement, and taught ecclesiology at the Pontifical University of Mexico from 1982 to 1985. While at the Pontifical University, he founded the Movement for the Days of Christian Life.\n[edit] Episcopal career and cardinalate\nOn November 5, 1985, Rivera was appointed Bishop of Tehuac\u00e1n by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 21 from Archbishop Antonio L\u00f3pez Avi\u00f1a, with Archbishops Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Rivera and Rosendo Huesca Pacheco serving as co-consecrators. During his tenure, he headed the Mexican Episcopal Conference's Commission for the Family (1989\u20131995) and the Family Section of the Latin American Episcopal Conference (1993\u20131995).\nRivera was later promoted to Archbishop of Mexico City, and thus de facto Primate Archbishop of Mexico, on June 13, 1995. John Paul II created him Cardinal-Priest of S. Francesco d'Assisi a Ripa Grande in the consistory of February 21, 1998. During his tenure, Juan Diego, to whom the iconic Our Lady of Guadalupe reportedly appeared, was canonized. Rivera was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave, which elected Pope Benedict XVI. He was suggested as a possible choice as pope.[1]\nWithin the Latin American Episcopal Conference, Rivera served as President of the Episcopal Committee of Culture from 2004 to 2006. He also holds membership in the Pontifical Council for the Family, Congregation for the Clergy, and Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in the Roman Curia.\nRivera Carrera is seen as a strong advocate of social justice: his criticism of globalization and political corruption so annoyed Mexico's Salinas government that it threatened to adopt a law forbidding priests from commenting on politics.\nRivera Carrera is seen as a conservative on virtually all church matters: in 1990, as Bishop of Tehuac\u00e1n, he closed a seminary that he charged was teaching \"Marxist\" theology; in 1996, he won a showdown by forcing the abbot of the basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe to resign who had publicly questioned the historical truth of Mary's appearance to Juan Diego.[2] Seen as an affable, friendly man, Rivera is best known for his opposition to abortion and artificial birth control and for his insistence on strict church discipline[3].\nDuring the Supreme Court of Mexico's debate on legalizing abortion, His Eminence, The Lord Cardinal Rivera Carrera (this is the formal and proper honorific title given to Cardinals in many Hispanic-speaking formerly Spanish countries, which emphasizes their status as Princes of the Church), Metropolitan Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico City and as such, the Roman Catholic Primate of Mexico, had this to say in a Catholic News Agency online article featured on Tuesday, September 27, 2011 article:\n\"Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera of Mexico City underscored that \"abortion is never a solution\" for anything.\nThe cardinal's comments came as the Supreme Court prepared to hold deliberations on a ruling proposed by Justice Fernando Franco that would overturn pro-life constitutional amendments enacted in numerous Mexican states and would effectively legalize abortion throughout the country.\nThe Church always reaches out to pregnant women who are being pressured at work, by family members or friends to remind each one of them of the great value of motherhood, the cardinal said on Sept. 25.\n\"We want to help women who are facing a difficult pregnancy to embrace the gift of motherhood, and the Church is set up to reach out to these women who are truly experiencing such difficulties,\" he said.\nHe also noted that at their meeting last month in Monterrey, the Mexican bishops emphacized that the \u201ctaking of human life through the various abortifacient techniques must not be tolerated, and the taking of the life a human being, even in its initial phases, is not licit.\u201d\nHuman life must never be considered \u201ca commercial product,\u201d the cardinal added. A \u201cchild is always a gift and never a right of anyone.\u201d\n\u201cHe has unique dignity that is personal and unrepeatable, and therefore the technological means for assisting in procreation must always respect this truth and avoid replacing the logic of love with the logic of reproduction as if the human being were the product of the market,\u201d Cardinal Rivera said.[4]\n[edit] Episcopal Succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nAntonio L\u00f3pez Avi\u00f1a\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nJos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez Zepeda\nApril 12, 1997\n\n\nMarcelino Hern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u00edguez\nFebruary 5, 1998\n\n\nFelipe Tejeda Garc\u00eda\nMarch 4, 2000\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Fletes Santana\nMarch 4, 2000\n\n\nGuillermo Rodrigo Teodoro Ortiz Mondrag\u00f3n\nMarch 4, 2000\n\n\nFrancisco Clavel Gil\nJune 27, 2001\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ National Catholic Reporter: \"Who Will Be the Next Pope?\" 2005\n^ National Catholic Reporter: \"Who Will Be the Next Pope?\" 2005\n^ National Catholic Reporter: \"Conservative bishop to head Mexico City see\" July 28, 1995\n^ http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/abortion-solves-nothing-mexican-cardinal-tells-court/\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nHoly See Press Office: Norberto Rivera Carrera\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nErnesto Corripio Ahumada\nArchbishop of Mexico\n1995\u2013present\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nIncumbent\n\n\nReligious titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nRafael Ayala y Ayala\nBishop of Tehuacan\n1985\u20131995\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nMario Espinosa Contreras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 36601240\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nRivera Carrera, Norberto\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\nJune 6, 1942\n\n\nPlace of birth\n\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 7038/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 40118/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 35329/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 12342/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1687772-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130227221852 ", "Name": "Norberto Rivera Carrera"}, {"url": "/wiki/Francis_George", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Francis Eugene George\u00a0O.M.I.\n\n\nCardinal-Archbishop of Chicago\n\n\n\nCardinal George at the May 2011 inauguration of Mayor Rahm Emanuel\n\n\nSee\nChicago\n\n\nAppointed\nApril 7, 1997\n\n\nEnthroned\nMay 7, 1997\n\n\nPredecessor\nJoseph Bernardin\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of S.

(n\u00e9e McCarthy) George.[3] He has an older sister, Margaret.[4] He received his early education at the parochial school of St. Pascal Church in Chicago's Northwest Side.[5]\nGeorge contracted polio at age 13.[6] Due to his disability, he was rejected by Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary, and instead enrolled at St. Henry Preparatory Seminary in Belleville, a high school seminary of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate.[7] He joined the Missionary Oblates on August 14, 1957.[3] He continued his studies at the Oblates novitiate in Godfrey before entering Our Lady of the Snows Seminary in Pass Christian, Mississippi.[5]\nGeorge was then sent to study theology at the University of Ottawa in Canada.[2] He made his solemn vows as a member of the Missionary Oblates on September 8, 1961.[5]\n[edit] Priesthood\nOn December 21, 1963, George was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Raymond Hillinger at his home parish of St. Pascal Church.[1] He received a Bachelor of Theology degree from the University of Ottawa in 1964, followed by a Master of Arts degree in Philosophy from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. in 1965.[2] He then taught philosophy at Our Lady of the Snows Seminary in Pass Christian (1964\u201369), Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana (1968), and Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska (1969\u20131973).[3]\nDuring his teaching assignments, George earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in American Philosophy from Tulane University in 1970, and a Master of Theology degree from the University of Ottawa in 1971.[4] He served as provincial superior of the Midwestern Province for the Missionary Oblates in Saint Paul, Minnesota, from 1973 until 1974, when he became vicar general of his religious order.[5] Based in Rome, he served as vicar general for 12 years. He obtained a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree from the Pontifical Urbaniana University in 1988, with a thesis entitled: \"Inculturation and communion\".[2]\nGeorge returned to the United States, where he served as coordinator of the Circle of Fellows at the Center for the Study of Faith and Culture in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1987\u201390).[4]\n[edit] Early episcopacy\nOn July 10, 1990, George was appointed the fifth Bishop of Yakima in Washington by Pope John Paul II.[1] He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 21 from Archbishop Agostino Cacciavillan, with Bishops Roger Schwietz, OMI, and William S. Skylstad serving as co-consecrators, at Holy Family Church in Yakima.[1] He took as his episcopal motto: Christo Gloria in Ecclesia (Latin: \"To Christ be Glory in the Church\").[8]\nGeorge served the Diocese of Yakima for five and a half years. As a member of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), he served as chair of the Commission for Bishops and Scholars (1992\u20131994), and as a consultant to the Committees on Evangelization (1991\u201393), Hispanic Affairs (1994\u201397), and Science and Values (1994\u201397).[3] He was episcopal advisor to the Cursillo Movement (Region XII) from 1990 to 1997, and episcopal moderator of the National Catholic Office for Persons with Disabilities from 1990 to 2008. He was a papal appointee to the 1994 World Synod of Bishops on Consecrated Life, and attended the Ninth Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Vatican City in October 1994.[2]\nOn April 30, 1996, George was appointed the ninth Archbishop of Portland in Oregon.[1] He was installed on the following May 27 at St. Mary's Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. During his brief tenure, he led the Archdiocese's response to a tape recording by the Lane County jail of an inmate's sacramental confession; the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later ruled that the tape recording was an unconstitutional and illegal act.[5]\n[edit] Archbishop of Chicago\n\n\nStyles of\nFrancis George\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nChicago\n\n\nLess than a year later, on April 8, 1997, Pope John Paul II appointed Archbishop George the eighth Archbishop of Chicago to fill a vacancy left by the death of Cardinal Joseph Bernardin on November 14, 1996. He was the first native Chicagoan to assume the office. On May 7 after his appointment, the Apostolic Pro-Nuncio Agostino Cacciavillan installed Archbishop George as Archbishop of Chicago in Holy Name Cathedral.\nOn January 18, 1998, Pope John Paul II announced Archbishop George's elevation to the Sacred College of Cardinals with the title of Cardinal-Priest of San Bartolomeo all'Isola. Newly named Cardinal George was awarded the privileges of the scarlet vestments and biretta in consistory at the Vatican on February 21.\nGeorge was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. He will be eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves that occur before January 16, 2017 when he will reach his 80th birthday.\nAt the conclave, he, like Cardinal Rigali of Philadelphia, was known as a conservative supporter of Benedict, saying afterward in a press conference, \"It was a choice that was apparent almost immediately.\"\nCardinal George publishes a locally well-read column bi-monthly in the Chicago archdiocesan newspaper of which he is Publisher, The Catholic New World, called \"The Cardinal's Column\". He is also the Publisher of the Archdiocese of Chicago's Hispanic and Polish newspapers, respectively Chicago Cat\u00f3lico and Katolik.\nHe has published at least two pastoral letters. The first, \"Becoming An Evangelizing People\", was released on November 21, 1997. The second was a major discourse on the sinful and destructive nature of racism, Dwell in My Love, released on April 4, 2001.\nThe Cardinal is the author of two locally well-known books. The first, The Difference God Makes: A Catholic Vision of Faith, Communion, and Culture, was published in October 2009 by Crossroad Publishing Company. It is a collection of essays exploring our relationship with God, the responsibility of communion and the transformation of culture. His most recent book, God in Action: How Faith in God Can Address the Challenges of the World, was published in May 2011 by Doubleday Religion. In this collection of essays, he reflects on the significance of religious faith in the public sphere and underscores the unique contributions of religion to the common good.\nAs Cardinal Bernardin referred to himself as \"Joseph your brother\", George refers to himself as \"Francis your neighbor\".\nGeorge is also known for continuing the work of his predecessor Cardinal Bernardin, regarding young people in the church \u2013 specifically, by addressing the archdiocese's annual Theology on Tap gathering in 1997. In his invitation to the event, he wrote, \u201cYou are very important members of the Church. Your energy, talent and faith will give me much help as together we build up our local Church to be a vital presence in the Chicago area. Together we can continue the mission of Jesus Christ to bring the Gospel of love, forgiveness and holiness to all the places where we live and encounter others.\u201d\n[edit] Interfaith relations\nIn 2007, he asked Jews to reconsider descriptions of Jesus in the Talmud as a \"bastard\" in exchange for a softening of traditional Catholic prayers calling for Jews to be converted to Christianity.[9] In 2009, he condemned negationist declarations made by bishop Richard Williamson, a member of the Society of Saint Pius X.[10]\nIn 2010, he spoke at Brigham Young University about the continued need for Catholics and Mormons to stand together to protect religious freedom. \"In recent years, Catholics and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have stood more frequently side by side in the public square to defend human life and dignity,\" Cardinal George said. He also praised the LDS Church for its efforts alongside the Catholic Church to combat poverty and pornography and the need to define marriage as between one man and one woman.[11]\nLater in 2010, he further outlined the degree to which he believed religious freedoms (in the United States and other Western societies) was endangered. In a speech to a group of priests, he said, \"I expect to die in bed, my successor will die in prison and his successor will die a martyr in the public square. His successor will pick up the shards of a ruined society and slowly help rebuild civilization, as the church has done so often in human history.\"[12] Originally published online without the second sentence,[13] this statement has widely been interpreted as reactionary by liberal members of the American political left and accurate by conservative members of the American political right.\n[edit] Extra-diocesan posts\nPope John Paul II appointed Cardinal George to several offices of the Roman Curia:\n\nCongregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments\nCongregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life\nCongregation for the Evangelization of Peoples\nPontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church\nCongregation for Oriental Churches\nPontifical Council for Culture\nPontifical Council Cor Unum\n\nIn 2010, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him to the Pontifical Council for the Study of the Organizational and Economic Problems of the Holy See.\nHe was appointed by Pope John Paul II to the 1994 World Synod of Bishops on Consecrated Life and a delegate and one of two special secretaries at the Synod of Bishops for America in 1997. He was a delegate of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to the 2001 World Synod of Bishops, and was also elected to the Council for the World Synod of Bishops in 2001. He served as a delegate of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for the 2008 World Synod of Bishops on \"The Word of God in the Life and Mission of the Church.\nHe served as Vice President (2004\u20132007) and President (2007\u20132010) of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He is a member of its Committee on Divine Worship and its Ad Hoc Committee on Shrines. He also serves as a consultant to the Committee on Doctrine and Pro-Life Activities and the Subcommittee on Lay Ministry.\nHe has also served on Conference of Bishops Committees on Doctrine, on Latin America, on Missions, on Religious Life, the American Board of Catholic Missions, and on World Missions; on the Ad Hoc Committee to Oversee the Use of the Catechism and the Subcommittee on Campus Ministry.\nHe was Chair of the Committee for Bishops and Scholars from 1992\u20131994, and of the Committee on Liturgy from 2001\u20132004, and a consultant to the Committees on Evangelization (1991\u20131993), Hispanic Affairs (1994\u20131997), Science and Values (1994\u20131997), and African American Catholics (1999\u20132002). He was the Representative to the International Commission on English and the Liturgy from 1997\u20132006.\nBecause of his position as Cardinal Archbishop of Chicago, since 1997, when he assumed the office, he has been the de facto Chancellor of the University of St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary (the Archdiocesan Seminary in the suburb of Mundelein, Illinois; both the seminary and the town are named after Cardinal George Mundelein, a deceased former Archbishop of Chicago).\nHe is the Chancellor, since 1997, of the Catholic Church Extension Society. He is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Washington, D.C.-based Catholic University of America since 1993. From 1997, he has been a Trustee of the Papal Foundation. In 1994, he became a member of the Board of Directors of the National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Since 1997, he has been a member of the Board of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.\nHe has been the Episcopal Liaison to the Catholic Campus Ministry Association Executive Board since 1998 and is now also the Episcopal Moderator for the Ministry of Transportation Chaplains, serving since 2003. He also served as Episcopal Advisor to the Cursillo Movement, Region XII, from 1990 to 1997.\nFrom 1990 to 2008, he was Episcopal Moderator and member of the board of the National Catholic Office for Persons with Disabilities (now known as the National Catholic Partnership on Disability). He brought personal experience to his role after a five-month bout with poliomyelitis at age 13 left him with permanent damage to his legs.\nCardinal George is Conventual Chaplain ad honorem of the Federal Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Grand Prior of the North Central Lieutenancy of the United States for the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, and a member of the Kohl McCormick Early Childhood Teaching Awards Advisory Board. He has been a member of the Board of Directors of Oblate Media, Belleville, Illinois, since 1988.\nHe is a member of the American Catholic Philosophical Association, the American Society of Missiologists, and the Catholic Commission on Intellectual and Cultural Affairs.\n[edit] Recent events and speculation on retirement and succession\nCardinal George had been mentioned as potential candidate to succeed Pope John Paul II according to TIME magazine[citation needed], and later to succeed Pope Benedict XVI as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. However, Benedict appointed former Archbishop of San Francisco William Levada to fill that office. He is a member of the board of trustees of the Catholic University of America, the Chancellor of Mundelein Seminary and Loyola University Chicago, and a member of the Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre. In May 2008, Father Robert Barron, a priest of the Archdiocese of Chicago, was named the first holder of the endowed Francis Cardinal George Chair of Systematic Theology at Mundelein Seminary, the second such named endowed chair the university started.\nIn March 2009 Cardinal George met with newly elected United States President Barack Obama.[14] In the fall of 2010, he finished his three-year presidency of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; he was succeeded by Archbishop Dolan of New York. Cardinal George turned 74 in January 2011, and as bishops are required to make an offer to the Pope to resign at age 75 (which may be deferred by the Pope until later), speculation is already beginning over who could succeed him given that George has had cancer, has fallen, and suffers from the after effects of childhood polio. However, he remains in relatively good shape considering those matters. He remains eligible to vote in future Papal conclaves until his 80th birthday in 2017.\nIn July 2011, Cardinal George was chosen to be one of eight U.S. Bishops- selected by the Roman Curia's Pontifical Council for the Laity, the Vatican body that convenes the event- to serve as catechists at the August 2011 World Youth Day celebration in Madrid, Spain.\nOn January 16, 2012, Cardinal George turned 75 and formally submitted his resignation to Pope Benedict XVI. The Cardinal noted he is a rarity among Chicago's bishops for having lived to see the possibility of retirement. He named the Very Reverend Father Peter F. \u015anieg, until then the Rector of St. Joseph's Seminary at Loyola University Chicago, as the Moderator of the Curia for the Archdiocese. Jimmy M. Lago remains as Chancellor. He has served for 12 years as Archdiocesan Chancellor. \u015anieg will report to the Cardinal. He appointed the Reverend Father Paul C. Stein, until then pastor of Chicago's St. Sylvester Parish, as Father \u015anieg's successor as Rector. The Cardinal anticipates remaining in office for about another two or three years so he can ensure a smooth transition, resolve certain issues and finish some current projects.[15]\n[edit] Comments on homosexuality\nA proposed change in route and start time for the 2012 annual Chicago Pride Parade (which would pass by a Catholic church on the new route) drew pointed criticism from Cardinal George. In a discussion with a Chicago Fox News Affiliate, the Cardinal said \"you don\u2019t want the Gay Liberation Movement to morph into something like the Ku Klux Klan.\"[16] In response, LGBT advocates in Chicago have called for the Cardinal's resignation.[17] The growing outcry resulted in the Cardinal's apology \"for the hurt\" his remarks seemed to have caused; the Cardinal's motivation for the remarks was a growing concern that the federal and state governments were impinging on the rights of Catholics by forcing them to abide by policies, enacted into law recently, which practicing Catholics who follow the Church's example would find questionable or objectionable. The Cardinal implied in his statements that he had either family members or close friends who had dealt either with being gay or lesbian or having family members who were.;[18] debate remains in the LGBT community as to whether this apology is sufficient.[19]\nLater, on New Year's Day, Tuesday, January 1, 2013, in an official pastoral letter to the priests and people of the Archdiocese that also served as his column in that issue of the The Catholic New World archdiocesan newspaper (co-signed by the incumbent Auxiliary Bishops of the Chicago Archdiocese and also appearing on the website of the Catholic Conference of Illinois), Cardinal George stated that the (likely imminent) passage of a same-sex marriage law in the state would be \"acting against the common good of society. This proposed legislation will have long-term consequences because laws teach; they tell us what is socially acceptable and what is not, and most people conform to the dictates of their respective society, at least in the short run\".[20]\n[edit] Second finding of cancer\nIn August 2012, Cardinal George underwent routine tests at the Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center at Loyola University Medical Center, in Maywood, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago- the institution where he had been treated six years prior in 2006 for bladder cancer in a multi-hour operation in which the bladder (cystectomy) and prostate (prostatectomy) had been removed, and doctors had eventually thought that the cancer had gone into full remission, the Cardinal having passed both the three- and five- year survival anniversaries that are traditionally used as benchmarks. He had been the only Archbishop of Chicago to be able to live to age 75 and submit his retirement while healthy- his predecessor and the Center's namesake, Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, had himself died in November 1996 of recurrent, metastatic pancreatic cancer. Most believed George to be relatively healthy. However, on Monday, August 20, 2012, the Archdiocese released a statement to the media and the public on its homepage, saying, in part, that the disease had somehow returned:\n\"As announced on Friday, August 17, Cardinal George learned from his doctors that test results from a procedure earlier in the week showed there were cancerous cells in his kidney and in a nodule that was removed from his liver. The Cardinal rested at home this weekend ... This week he will continue additional testing ...\"[21]\nThe above statement was updated later on Tuesday, August 28, 2012, which stated that, after his doctors at Loyola had consulted with his Rochester, Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic doctors, and after confirming the two cancerous areas, a course of attempted chemotherapy involving multiple sessions had been agreed upon, which would seem to suggest that an attempt will be made to fight the cancer again despite its presence in two vital organs.[21] Officials of the Archdiocese have requested that parishioners recite the Tolton Prayer while praying for his health as he begins chemotherapy in September 2012. The prayer is named after the locally well-known Father Augustus Tolton, a black African-American priest of the Archdiocese whose Cause for Canonization (Sainthood) is being promoted by the Archdiocese.\nBecause of the recurrence of his cancer, though it is not yet a pressing issue, Cardinal George may eventually ask for permission from Pope Benedict XVI to retire earlier than the two years he had originally planned. Some have speculated that he will ask for a coadjutor archbishop, a type of auxiliary bishop who would serve as one of his vicar generals and who would automatically succeed him when he retires or dies.\nThe Cardinal, after celebrating Mass (with little help from aides) for the First Sunday of Advent on Sunday, December 2, 2012, at Chicago's Queen of All Saints Basilica, told Chicago Tribune reporters he was feeling relatively well, even if he was very tired some days, and was expecting at the time to finish his current rounds of chemotherapy in January 2013 (one woman remarked his color was very good and Cardinal George was overheard telling a man they should have lunch sometime after Christmas). This suggests that, so far, at least, he is holding his own in his second bout with cancer.[22]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c d e Cheney, David. \"Francis Eugene Cardinal George, O.M.I.\".

After studying at the archdiocesan seminary of Pozna\u0144, Grocholewski, was ordained to the priesthood on 27 May 1963[2] by Archbishop Antoni Baraniak, who had also previously ordained him a subdeacon and deacon.[3]\nAfter his 21 December 1982 appointment as titular bishop of Acropolis,[3] he received his episcopal consecration on the following 6 January from John Paul II himself, with Archbishops Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Somalo and Duraisamy Lourdusamy serving as co-consecrators. Grocholewski was promoted to the rank of Archbishop on 16 December 1991. On 15 November 1999 he was appointed the prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education[4] and the Grand Chancellor of the Pontifical Gregorian University.[2]\nGrocholewski was created Cardinal-Deacon of San Nicola in Carcere by John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001.[3] Upon the death of Pope John Paul all major Vatican officials automatically lose their positions during a sede vacante, and the cardinal so lost his position on 2 April 2005 due to the death of the Pope. He was later confirmed to office by Pope Benedict XVI on 21 April. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.[5] On 21 February 2011, he opted for the order of Cardinal Priest, with his former diaconal church elevated to the level of cardinalitial title.[6]\nAlong with his native Polish, he speaks Latin, Italian, French, Spanish, and English.\nHe is a Curial member of the Doctrine of the Faith, Bishops (congregations), the Legislative Texts (council) and the Special Council for Oceania of the Secretariat General (Synod of Bishops)[7] Cardinal Grocholewski was also the official extraordinary envoy of the Pope to the 400th year foundation of the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, Manila, the oldest university in the Asia.\n[edit] Teaching Activities in Universities, Publications, and Honors\nThe Cardinal taught at the Faculty of Canon Law of the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome (1975-1999), and at the Faculty of Canon Law of the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome (1980-1984). He also gave lectures on Administrative Justice at the Studio Rotale of the Roman Rota (1986-1998).[8]\nBeing an author of numerous publications in different languages, His Eminence has been frequently invited to speak and to give talks at national and international conferences and conventions, held in various countries around the world. He is also connected with a number of Canon Law associations, and with the editorial boards of some academic reviews and journals.[8]\nAmong the many honors received by Zenon Cardinal Grocholewski are: 18 honorary Doctorates; the Grand Medal of San Gorazdo of the Ministry of Education of Slovakia (2000); the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit (Chile) (2003); the Grand Cross of Merit with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2005); the Commander\u2019s Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta (2009); Commander of l\u2019Ordre des Palmes acad\u00e9miques of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of France (2009).[8]\n[edit] Recent Important Act as Prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education\nIn March 2011 at a press conference to present the newly-published Decree on the Reform of Ecclesiastical Studies of Philosophy. Cardinal Grocholewski explained how the normative documents concerning ecclesiastical studies \u2013 and hence also philosophy \u2013 currently comprehend John Paul II's 1979 Apostolic Constitution \"Sapientia christiana\" and its norms of application issued in the same year by the Congregation for Catholic Education. \"Nonetheless\", he said, \"'Ecclesia semper est reformanda' in order to respond to the new demands of ecclesial life in changing historical-cultural circumstances and this also (perhaps especially) involves the academic world\". The reasons for the reform are, the cardinal explained, \"on the one hand, the shortcomings in philosophical formation at many ecclesiastical institutions, where precise points of reference are lacking especially as regards the subjects to be taught and the quality of teachers. ... On the other hand there is the conviction \u2013 expressed in John Paul II's 1998 Encyclical Fides et ratio of the importance of the metaphysical component of philosophy, ... and the awareness that philosophy is indispensable for theological formation\". For this reason today's decree of the congregation aims to re-evaluate philosophy, above all in the light of that Encyclical, ... restoring the 'original vocation' of philosophy; i.e., the search for truth and its sapiental and metaphysical dimension\".[9]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Nauka Polska\n^ a b Catholic Pages\n^ a b c Catholic Hierarchy\n^ Roman Curia, Congregation for Catholic Education, Profile\n^ Fox News, Fast Facts: List of Cardinal Electors, 18 April 2005\n^ Concistoro per il voto su alcune cause di canonizzazione 21 February 2011\n^ Catholic News Agency\n^ a b c Cf.

He taught theology at the Lateran and Urbanian Pontifical Universities and then studied at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy.\n[edit] Career in the Curia\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Cardinal Sepe\n\n\nHe joined the diplomatic service of the Holy See and was posted to Brazil from 1972 to 1975, when he was recalled to the Secretariat of State, becoming Assessor for General Affairs in 1987. Sepe was appointed Secretary of the Congregation for the Clergy and Titular Archbishop of Gradum on 2 April 1992.\nOn 3 November 1997, he was named General Secretary of the Central Committee for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. He was President of Peregrinatio ad Petri Sedem from 8 November 1997 until July 2001. On 9 April 2001 he was named Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. He is also the Grand Chancellor of the Pontifical Urban University. Created and proclaimed Cardinal-Deacon of Dio Padre misericordioso by Pope John Paul II in the Consistory of 21 February 2001. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nCurial membership:\n\nClergy, Doctrine of the Faith (congregations)\nSocial Communications, Interreligious Dialogue, Christian Unity, Legislative Texts (councils)\nLatin America (commission)\nSpecial Council for Asia of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops\n\n\n\n\n\nA statue of Sepe\n\n\n[edit] Cardinal-Archbishop of Naples\nHe was appointed Archbishop of Naples and his Cardinal-Deaconry was elevated pro hac vice to Cardinal-Priest on 20 May 2006 (it was too early for him to opt for the order of cardinal priests).\nCardinal Sepe's move to Naples from the prefect's post at the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples made him the first head of a Roman dicastery in decades to be dispatched to a diocese and, in the eyes of some, the first casualty of Pope Benedict's purge of the church's administration.\nCardinal Sepe has been a member of Facebook, where he collected the maximum of 5,000 friends.\nIn June 2010, Sepe was under investigation by Perugia's public prosecutor's office over alleged corruption cases.[2] Media reports alleged that during his time as prefect, various \u201cPropaganda Fide\u201d apartments were made available, free or for a very low rent, to a variety of public figures including politicians, lawyers and journalists. However, Cardinal Sepe has reportedly said that he has \u201cnothing to hide\u201d and he is expected to waive his Vatican extraterritorial privilege in order to meet investigators.[3]\nCardinal Sepe said[citation needed] in the homily at his morning Mass, appeared[who?] to refer implicitly to the probe, speaking of the \"many martyrs\" who, \"in the name of truth and of Christ, remained faithful to his Gospel when they were tortured, humiliated and disrespected.\" He continued saying \"We must not be afraid,\" he said, according to an Italian wire report. After Calvary, there will be the light of the resurrection.\"\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Clerical celibacy\nMany of his memorable statements came from 1995 to 1997 and involved disagreement with the idea of ending the celibate priesthood.\nIn 1997 he said a relaxing of the celibacy rule for Latin Rite priests would not ease the vocations crisis and would have no theological or pastoral foundation. Linked to his position he also is active in evangelizing efforts.\n[edit] Priest-sharing program\nIn 1995 he helped implement a priest-sharing program among dioceses worldwide to help redress the geographical imbalance in vocations.\n[edit] Return of priests\nIn that year he further said that the Vatican was facilitating the return of hundreds of priests who had left the active ministry and married in civil ceremonies, but who were now divorced or widowed and were \u201csincerely sorry\u201d for having strayed from their vocation.\n[edit] Crime in Naples\nAs Archbishop in 2007 he called on \"the youth of Italy's murder capital to unsheathe [their] courage and hand over their knives in church, anonymously and without penalty\"[4].\n[edit] References\n\n^ \"Vatican appoints seasoned diplomat to direct church's worldwide missionary work\".

He returned to his studies and earned a doctorate in dogmatic theology from the University of T\u00fcbingen. He was a faculty member at T\u00fcbingen from 1958 to 1961 and worked for three years as an assistant to the conservative Leo Scheffczyk and the liberal Hans K\u00fcng, who was banned from teaching by Vatican authorities owing to his critical views on contraception and papal infallibility.\nHe later taught dogmatic theology at the Westphalian University of M\u00fcnster (1964\u20131970), rising to become dean of the theological faculty in 1969 and then the same in T\u00fcbingen in 1970. In 1983, Kasper taught as a visiting professor at The Catholic University of America. He was editor of the Lexikon f\u00fcr Theologie und Kirche.\n[edit] Bishop and cardinal\n[edit] Bishop of Rottenburg-Stuttgart\nKasper was named Bishop of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, Germany's fourth largest Catholic diocese, on 17 April 1989. He was consecrated as a bishop on 17 June that same year by Archbishop Oskar Saier of Freiburg im Breisgau; Bishops Karl Lehmann and Franz Kuhnle served as co-consecrators. In 1993 he and other members of the German episcopate signed a pastoral letter allowing divorced and civilly remarried German Catholics to return to the sacraments, to the disapproval of then Cardinal Ratzinger. In 1994, he was named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.\n[edit] Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity\nOn 3 March 1999, Kasper was appointed President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity - and as such, President of the Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews - and resigned from his post in Rottenburg-Stuttgart. He was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001 (along with Leo Scheffczyk), as Cardinal-Deacon of Ognissanti in Via Appia Nuova. He was critical of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith document Dominus Iesus, issued in 2000, which he believed was an offense to the Jewish people. He was often criticised by conservatives for his role in ecumenism. In February 2011 Cardinal Kasper revealed the that over the course of his career: he was forced to drink vodka while in Moscow for talks with the Russian Orthodox Church. One Orthodox metropolitan, he said, even insisted that he drink vodka for breakfast\u2014though in that case, Kasper said, the vodka was actually fairly good.\nOn 21 February 2011, he opted for the order of Cardinal-Priest, with his former diaconal church elevated to the level of cardinalitial title.\n[edit] Reconciliation with Jews\nIn 2003, he wrote a text called Anti-semitism: A wound to be healed for the European Day of Jewish Culture.[1] On July 10, 2004, at the Latin-American Rabbinical Seminary of Buenos Aires, the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation and the Angelo Roncalli Committee presented to Cardinal Kasper the \"Memorial Mural Award\", for his lifetime dedication to the causes of understanding and reconciliation between Jews and Catholics.[2]\n[edit] International Theological Commission\n\n\nStyles of\nWalter Kasper\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nRottenburg-Stuttgart (Emeritus)\n\n\nKasper is a member of the International Theological Commission, an advisory body to the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith. Upon the death of John Paul II on 2 April 2005, Kasper and all major Vatican officials, in accord with custom, automatically lost their positions during the sede vacante. He was a cardinal elector in the 2005 papal conclave. On the following 21 April, Pope Benedict XVI confirmed him as President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. He has repeatedly led official delegations of the Vatican on the annual visit to the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople, on the occasion of the patronal feast of Saint Andrew. In August 2007, he was the head of the Roman Catholic delegation that participated at the funeral ceremony of Patriarch Teoctist of the Romanian Christian Orthodox Church.\n[edit] Book on the Eucharist\nIn 2005, Cardinal Kasper wrote a book entitled Sacrament Of Unity: The Eucharist and the Church, a reflection on the Eucharist partly inspired by John Paul II's encyclical Ecclesia de Eucharistia. In this book, he strongly insisted on the sacrificial character of the Eucharist, an aspect somewhat overshadowed after the Council.\n[edit] Book about Jesus Christ\nFirst published in 1976, Cardinal Kasper's book Jesus The Christ treats of the subject of Christology in three manners: A contemporary approach, a historical approach and a factual approach. After these three approaches have been exhausted, the Chrisotlogical themes of resurrection, mystery, and priesthood are treated. Ecclesiology is seen as part of Christology in this book because the Church is oriented towards Christ in his person. And Christ did not only say things, but he also did things.[3]\n[edit] Society of Saint Pius X\nIn January 2009, Kasper told The New York Times that he had little, if any, input on whether to lift the excommunication of four bishops of the Society of Saint Pius X.[4] This action was especially controversial because of the views of one of the bishops regarding the Holocaust, although his views on this matter had nothing to do with the original excommunication: British-born Bishop Richard Williamson had claimed that reports about the Holocaust were exaggerated and that no Jews died in Nazi gas chambers. [1]\nAs the Vatican official responsible for relations with the Jewish religion, Kasper felt it necessary to comment on the action and the process leading up to the lifting of the excommunications. Kasper said that: \"Up to now people in the Vatican have spoken too little with each other and have not checked where problems might arise\". In reference to the lifting of the excommunications, he continued, saying that \"there were misunderstandings and management errors in the Curia.\"\n[edit] Comments on Britain\nIn September 2010, Cardinal Kasper pulled out of the papal visit to Britain, after reportedly saying that Heathrow Airport gives the impression of a Third World country and that the United Kingdom is marked by \"a new and aggressive atheism\".[5] In an interview with German magazine Focus, the cardinal was quoted as saying: \"When you land at Heathrow you think at times you have landed in a Third World country,\" as well as adding criticism of British Airways (BA), a comment not unlike those presented at the Review Centre website, but Kasper's secretary explained it as \"a description of the many different people that live in Britain at the moment\".[6] With regard to British Airways, he said that, when one wears a cross on the airline \"you are discriminated against\", a reference to the British Airways cross controversy. British Airways said that Kasper had been \"seriously misinformed\" in his claims about the airline, and that \"It is completely untrue that we discriminate against Christians or members of any faith\".[5]\nA spokesman for the Church in Britain said that Kasper's remarks were not the views of the Vatican or of the Church.[5] The cardinal's secretary said that Kasper had decided not to travel because of difficulty in walking, because of gout.[6] He also explained the cardinal's reference to \"aggressive atheism\" in Britain as his way of describing people like Richard Dawkins, (a prominent atheist) who have been very critical of the Pope and who had even talked about making a \"citizens arrest\" of the Pope while in Britain.[6]\n[edit] Papal conclave, 2013\nMain article: Papal conclave, 2013\nKasper will likely be the oldest cardinal eligible to vote in the Papal conclave of 2013. According to section 33 of Universi Dominici Gregis, only cardinals \"who have reached their eightieth birthday before the day of the Roman Pontiff's death or the day when the Apostolic See becomes vacant\" do not vote.[7] His 80th birthday will be 5 March 2013.\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Anti-semitism: A wound to be healed\n^ Cardinal Walter Kasper distinguished by the Wallenberg Foundation and the Angelo Roncalli Committee\n^ WALTER KASPER, Jesus the Christ, translated by V.

After graduating from the Jesuit-run St. Stanislaus High School, he entered the seminary of the Archdiocese of Bombay and was later ordained to the priesthood by Valerian Gracias on 8 December 1958.[2] He then did pastoral work in Bombay as curate at St. Stephen's Church until 1961, when he was sent to Rome to further his studies. He there attended the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy and the Pontifical Lateran University, from where he obtained a doctorate in canon law in 1964.[3]\n[edit] Secretariat of State\nDias worked in the Vatican Secretariat of State preparing the 1964 visit of Pope Paul VI to India, during which he was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 4 December.[3] From 1965 to 1973, he served as secretary of the nunciatures in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Indonesia, Madagascar, R\u00e9union, the Comoro Islands and Mauritius. Returning to the Secretariat of State in Vatican City, he was head of the section for the Soviet Union, the Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Bulgaria, China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Zambia, Kenya and Tanzania until 1982.[3]\n[edit] Nuncio and bishop\nOn 8 May 1982, Dias was appointed Titular Archbishop of Rusibisir and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Ghana, Togo and Benin by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 19 June from Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, with Archbishops Achille Silvestrini and Duraisamy Simon Lourdusamy serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter's Basilica.[2] He selected as his episcopal motto: \"Servus\" (Latin: \"Servant\").[4] Dias was later named Apostolic Nuncio to Korea on 20 June 1987, and Apostolic Nuncio to Albania on 28 October 1991. In Albania, he was charged with rebuilding the local church after nearly five decades of communist rule, inviting foreign missionaries to the country and working with the Albanian government to recover Catholic churches and schools.[5]\n\n\nStyles of\nIvan Dias\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nBombay (Emeritus)\n\n\n[edit] Archbishop\nRecalled from the Vatican's diplomatic service, Dias was appointed the ninth Archbishop of Bombay on 8 November 1996.[2] He was an outspoken supporter of the controversial 2000 document of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Dominus Iesus, which declared that non-Catholics \"are in a gravely deficient situation in comparison with those who, in the Church, have the fullness of the means of salvation.\"[6] Dias said the document was \"a reaffirmation...[that] Jesus is the only savior of the world. We have a right to say who we are, and others can accept it or not.\"[5]\n[edit] Cardinal\nJohn Paul II created him Cardinal-Priest of Spirito Santo alla Ferratella in the consistory of 21 February 2001.[3] He was shortly afterwards named to the Council of Cardinals for the Study of the Organizational and Economic Problems of the Holy See on 10 March 2001, and served as one of the three presidents at the 10th Ordinary Assembly of the World Synod of Bishops from September to October 2001.[3]\nIn 2003, he delivered the homily at the beatification Mass of Mother Teresa, whom Dias had befriended during his tenure as a nuncio in Albania; he once said, \u201cReaching out to our fellow human beings, embracing the poor as Mother Teresa did, must become a common service for every Christian.\u201d[4] Lamenting the domination of the world \"by information technology, by New Age teaching and by the decline of ethical values,\" Dias once stated that entire countries are being \"crushed down by godless ideologies and enticing proposals that exalt the anti-God cultures, including the culture of death.\"[5]\nHe was one of the Cardinals considered papabile at the 2005 Papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. TIME Magazine noted his \"[s]trong diplomatic experience\" and said his election \"would represent a bold choice from the developing world.\"[7]\nOn 20 May 2006, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, the top post overseeing the Catholic missions, a post whose holder was once known as the \"Red Pope\" due to the extent of his authority over the Church in mission lands. He was also ex officio the Grand Chancellor of the Pontifical Urbaniana University. His resignation, presented on reaching 75 years of age, was published on 10 May 2011, when he was succeeded by Fernando Filoni.\nCardinal Dias is a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Pontifical Council for Culture, the Pontifical Council for the Laity, the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church, and the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts. He will hold these memberships until his 80th birthday.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Anti-Christian violence\nDuring his tenure as Archbishop, Dias frequently condemned anti-Christian discrimination in Indian society by Hindu fundamentalists. In December 2001, he invited leaders of all Bombay's religious communities to his home for \"a meeting for peace in a world torn apart by war and hatred.\"[5] In 2002, he denounced pressures put by Indian authorities on Catholic schools, which have \"had to put up with uncooperative and abusive public officials as well intimidation.\"\n[edit] Abortion and homosexuality\nDias also established himself as theologically conservative, strongly maintaining the Church's stances against abortion and homosexuality.[8][9] He believes that gays and lesbians can be \"cured\" of their \"unnatural tendencies\" through the Sacrament of Penance.[5]\n[edit] Anglican communion\nDuring a speech he gave at the Lambeth Conference, his unequivocal language laid bare his disapproval of the chaos sweeping through the world's third biggest Christian denomination. He said: \"When we live myopically in the fleeting present, oblivious of our past heritage and apostolic traditions, we could well be suffering from spiritual Alzheimer's. [...] or ecclesial Parkinson's\".[10]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"'I am upset at the media hype'\".

As a boy, he dreamed of playing the saxophone in a dance band or becoming a pilot. Instead, he received an internal call for the religious life, and joined the Salesians on May 3, 1961.\nHe earned doctorates in philosophy from the Institute \"Don Rua\" in El Salvador, in theology from the Salesian Pontifical University in Rome, and moral theology from the Pontifical Lateran University. From the Austrian University of Innsbruck Rodr\u00edguez received a diploma in clinical psychology and psychotherapy.\nHe was ordained a priest on July 28, 1970, by Archbishop Girolam Prigione in Guatemala City. Father Rodr\u00edguez was named the bishop's assistant in Tegucigalpa in the same year. He was rector for three years at Guatemala's Francisco Marroqu\u00edn University from 1975.\nHe then taught chemistry, physics, and music at Salesian colleges in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala over the next fifteen years. During this time he also became a professor of moral theology and ecclesiology at the Salesian Theological Institute in Guatemala. He is also trained in classical piano, and did studies in music in El Salvador, Guatemala, and the United States.\nMultilingual cardinal, he speaks English, French, Italian, German, and Portuguese in addition to his native Spanish.\n[edit] Bishop and Cardinal\nOn October 28, 1978, Rodr\u00edguez was named auxiliary bishop of Tegucigalpa and titular bishop of Pudentiana. He received episcopal consecration on the following December 8 from Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo, with Archbishops H\u00e9ctor Santos Hern\u00e1ndez and Miguel Obando serving as co-consecrators. Rodr\u00edguez was named Archbishop of Tegucigalpa on January 8, 1993.\nArchbishop Rodr\u00edguez was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria della Speranza by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001. He is the first cardinal from Honduras\nIn addition to his episcopal responsibilities, he is currently the President of the Episcopal Conference of Honduras. Rodr\u00edguez was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nHe was considered by some to be a possible successor to Pope John Paul II, but he reportedly got only two votes in the first ballot.\nCardinal Rodr\u00edguez was elected on 5 June 2007 as the new Caritas Internationalis President by the Caritas Confederation members at their 18th General Assembly in Vatican City. He was reelected 24 May 2011.[2] As its President, he is the global representative of the Caritas Confederation for the next four years.\nSince December 2001 he has received a pension of 100,000 lempiras a month from the budget of the President of Honduras specified in Acuerdo Ejecutivo 046-2001 published December 7, 2002 in La Gaceta.[3][4]\nOn 12 June 2012 Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga was appointed a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education for a five year renewable term.[5]\n[edit] Views\nWidely viewed as a moderate, he is considered[who?] a rising star of the Latin American Church.[citation needed] His campaign for human rights and the poor have won widespread praise[who?].[citation needed] Cardinal Rodr\u00edguez is further admired[who?] as a dynamic pastor who brokered peace accords with rebels and led rebuilding efforts after a natural disaster.[citation needed]\nHe was the Vatican's spokesperson with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on the issue of Third World debt, and has encouraged countries to give development aid.[1]\nThe Cardinal has criticized Ricky Martin over his use of a surrogate mother for fathering his children.[6]\nHe has said that a politician who publicly supports abortion excommunicates himself, and that it's not question of receiving Communion or not, since he has already done serious harm to the communion of faith of the Church.[7]\nIn 2009, Cardinal Maradiaga agreed with the Pope that condoms cannot be of any real benefit in the fight against AIDS.[8]\nCardinal Maradiaga, in a May 2002 interview with the Italian-Catholic publication 30 Giorni, claimed that in order to divert attention from the Israeli-Palestinian crisis; Jews influenced the media to exploit the current controversy regarding sexual abuse by Catholic priests. This provoked outrage from the anti-Defamation League.[9]\n[edit] Influence in 2009 Honduras Coup\nRodriguez was first Manuel Zelaya's friend. In 2008 he criticized Zelaya for using public money to promote his plans instead of spending it on the poor. He stated: \"We were good friends. But he changed drastically... It was Ch\u00e1vez.\"[10]\nThe Church, according to a spokesman, did not favor deposed President Manuel Zelaya's alleged re-election plans nor a coup. In a televised speech, Rodriguez warned that the return of Zelaya could lead to a blood bath. He also called on the new government to promote national reconciliation and let aside revenge, pursuit, violence and corruption. He further urged the Organization of American States to investigate all the illegal deeds that happened during the rule of Zelaya. [11][12] Rodriguez was later accused by Zelaya of conspiring and collaborating with the coup leaders.[13]\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nH\u00e9ctor Enrique Santos Hern\u00e1ndez\nArchbishop of Tegucigalpa\n8 January 1993 \u2013\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nIncumbent\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b Caritas Internationalis President\n^ http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/additions-11.htm\n^ \"La Gaceta\". 2009-07-08. http://www.box.net/services/ipaper_by_scribd/102/307172878/7b0879/Partida_para_el_Cardenal_Rodr_guez/shared/6fybann57b.

He studied industrial engineering at the Universidad Nacional de Ingenier\u00eda in Lima, Peru.\n[edit] As a Priest\nAfter working as an engineer, he was ordained as a priest for the Personal Prelature of the Holy Cross and Opus Dei in 1977; he also holds a doctorate in theology from the University of Navarra. In his service to the church, he did pastoral work in Lima, taught at the Pontifical Faculty of Theology, and was regional vicar for Peru and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Piura.\nIn 1988, he was appointed titular Bishop of Turuzi and Auxiliary of Ayacucho, and was promoted to Archbishop of Ayacucho in 1995. During the 1996\u20131997 Japanese embassy hostage crisis, he attempted to negotiate a peaceful settlement, and ministered to Japanese and Peruvian hostages.\n[edit] As Archbishop\nNamed Archbishop of Lima in 1999, Cipriani was proclaimed Cardinal-Priest of San Camillo de Lellis by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001, with the title Cardinal-Priest of San Camillo de Lellis.\nHe was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI, and was himself considered papabile \u2014 a possible successor to the papacy.[citation needed]\nThe cardinal is a member of the Personal Prelature Opus Dei; he was the first priest incardinated into Opus Dei to be made a cardinal. He is also Grand Chancellor of the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa. In 2008 he banned receiving Communion on the hand, instead ordering that the faithful take it on the tongue. He said that \"the relaxed attitude of many priests\" was to blame for a decline in reverence for the Eucharist among the faithful. [1]\nOn 19 July 2011, he was named as a member of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America by Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Homosexuality\nIn 1997, the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PCUP), in Lima, barred a gay student organisation from holding any events. The organisation, Parenthesis Collective (Colectivo Par\u00e9ntesis), was formed by two third-year students, Rodrigo Vecco and Bernardo Nieuwland. In addition, the university distributed a pamphlet, \u201cSexual Identity: Is It Possible to Choose?\u201d which described homosexuality as a curable illness. The pamphlet was prepared at the request of the university\u2019s chancellor, Cardinal Cipriani.\nIn 2005, during a Mass marking the 36th anniversary of Ricardo Palma University, Cipriani commented on the recent legalisation of homosexual unions in Spain. He denounced the existence of a worldwide campaign that sells \u201cdamaged goods,\u201d calling a relationship that is \u201cnot between a man a woman\u201d marriage, and he warned that by legalising homosexual unions, society is disfigured. He warned that, \u201cIn today\u2019s world, evil disguises itself as good, it is imposed on others, and woe to him who does not accept it!\u201d. The cardinal called on the faithful not to refer to relationships that \u201care not between a man and a woman\u201d as marriage.\n\n\u201cCall it what you want but don\u2019t sell damaged goods, don\u2019t traffic in that dictatorship of moral relativism in which there is nothing good, only opinions and trends of thought.\u201d\n\nIn March 2007, PCUP filed a lawsuit against Mr. Walter Mu\u00f1oz Cho, who was appointed to the Board of Directors by Cardinal Cipriani. In 2010 legal proceedings between the Archdiocese and the PCUP began on the issue of autonomy of senior academic appointments and the University's property rights.\n[edit] Relations with the Jesuits\nHe was also accused of hampering the efforts of Jesuit human rights workers in Ayacucho while he was the Archbishop of that troubled province of Peru.\n[edit] La Cantuta massacre\nCardinal Cipriani said that people who believed that the La Cantuta massacre was committed by the Army of Peru were guilty of \"treason of the fatherland.\"[2] The massacre was later proved to have indeed been committed by members of the Army Intelligence Service, working within the Grupo Colina.\n[edit] Capital punishment\nCipriani has considered that conditions in Peru argue for the permissibility of capital punishment in certain very limited cases, where the criminal poses to society a real threat that probably cannot be safely contained by less severe means, including life imprisonment without parole. For example, shortly after the capture of violent revolutionary Abimael Guzm\u00e1n, Cardinal Cipriani Thorne expressed an opinion that the Shining Path leader should be executed. He referred to Peruvians who opposed the institution of the death penalty as \"cowards\".[1]\n[edit] Human rights\nSince the early 1980s Cardinal Cipriani has been seen as showing hostility to certain human rights groups, including some led by Catholic priests and laypeople. In contrast to his predecessor, the Jesuit Augusto Vargas Alzamora, he has often been accused of not giving heed to claims of human rights abuses purportedly committed by Peruvian state forces during the 1980s and 1990s.\nSome remarks of his have been seen as questionable, most famously perhaps his reference, in a 1994 interview with Caretas in which he expounded his views on human rights, to the Human Rights Coordinator as \"esa cojudez\", which roughly translates to \"that bullshit.\"[1]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 3.3.1\n\n\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAugusto Vargas Alzamora\nArchbishop of Lima\n9 January 1999\u2013incumbent\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nBiography at catholic-pages.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 19153554\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nt\ne\n\n\nOpus Dei\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nOpus Dei\nPriestly Society of the Holy Cross\nTypes of membership of Opus Dei\nNumerary\nSupernumerary\nTeachings of Opus Dei\nTimeline of Opus Dei\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey People\n\n\n\nJosemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1 (Canonization)\nJohn Masso\nJavier Echevarr\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez\n\u00c1lvaro del Portillo\nJoseph Muzquiz\nScott Hahn\nJoaqu\u00edn Navarro-Valls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversities\n\n\n\nUniversity of Navarra\nPontifical University of the Holy Cross\nIPADE\nLexington College\nStrathmore University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchools\n\n\n\nCol\u00e9gio Planalto\nThe Heights School (Maryland)\nNorthridge Preparatory School\nPAREF Northfield School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpus Dei Literature\n\n\n\nCamino (film)\nThe Da Vinci Code\nL'Opus Dei : enqu\u00eate sur le \"monstre\"\nOpus Dei: An Objective Look Behind the Myths and Reality of the Most Controversial Force in the Catholic Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurches and Shrines\n\n\n\nTorreciudad\nSt Mary Star of the Sea, West Melbourne\nSt. Peter's Church, Vienna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLists and Other\n\n\n\nBibliography of Opus Dei\nControversies about Opus Dei\nCorporate work\nList of members of Opus Dei\nOpus Dei and Catholic Church leaders\nOpus Dei and politics\nOpus Dei in society\nWomen in Opus Dei\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nCipriani Thorne, Juan Luis\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n28 December 1943\n\n\nPlace of birth\nLima\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 7447/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 39129/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 51474/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 15927/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 21/40\nExpensive parser function count: 3/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1688102-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130227230638 ", "Name": "Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne"}, {"url": "/wiki/Cl%C3%A1udio_Hummes", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Cl\u00e1udio Hummes O.F.M.\n\n\nPrefect Emeritus of the Congregation for the Clergy\n\n\n\n\n\nSee\nS\u00e3o Paulo (Emeritus)\n\n\nAppointed\n31 October 2006\n\n\nReign ended\n7 October 2010\n\n\nPredecessor\nDar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos\n\n\nSuccessor\nMauro Piacenza\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of S.

Taking the name Cl\u00e1udio upon his profession as a Franciscan, he was ordained to the priesthood on 3 August 1958 by Archbishop Jo\u00e3o Resende Costa, SDB. He obtained a doctorate in philosophy in 1963 from the Pontifical University Antonianum in Rome.\nFrom 1963 until 1968, he taught philosophy at the Franciscan seminary in Garibaldi, the major seminary of Viam\u00e3o and at the Pontifical Catholic University of Porto Alegre. He then studied at the Ecumenical Institute of Bossey in Geneva, Switzerland, from where he received an specialization in ecumenism. He was adviser for ecumenical affairs to the National Bishops' Conference of Brazil, Provincial Superior of the Franciscans of Rio Grande do Sul (1972\u20131975), and president of the Union of Latin American Conferences of Franciscans.\nAlong with his native Portuguese, he can also speak Spanish, German, and Italian.\n[edit] Episcopal career\nOn 22 March 1975, he was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Santo Andr\u00e9 and Titular Bishop of Carcabia. Hummes received his episcopal consecration on the following 25 May from Archbishop Alo\u00edsio Lorscheider, OFM, with Bishops Mauro Morelli and Urbano Allgayer serving as co-consecrators. He later succeeded Jorge de Oliveira as Bishop of Santo Andr\u00e9 on 29 December of that same year. Hummes allowed the labour unions to meet in parishes throughout his diocese, going against the dictatorship in Brazil at the time. It was here that he began his support for liberation theology, and forged his friendship with the union boss at the time, Lula. On 29 May 1996 he was promoted to Archbishop of Fortaleza and was then transferred to S\u00e3o Paulo on 15 April 1998.\n\n\nStyles of\nCl\u00e1udio Hummes\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nS\u00e3o Paulo (Emeritus)\n\n\n[edit] Cardinalate\nHe was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Antonio da Padova in Via Merulana by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001.[1] He later preached the Lenten spiritual exercises for John Paul II and the Roman Curia in 2002. One of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Hummes was often mentioned as a possible successor to Pope John Paul II.\nCardinal Hummes has Curial membership of Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Congregation for Bishops, Congregation for Catholic Education, Pontifical Council for the Laity, Pontifical Council for the Family, Pontifical Council Cor Unum, Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, Pontifical Council for Culture, Pontifical Commission for Latin America, X Ordinary Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops, Council of Cardinals for the Study of Organizational, and Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See. He will hold membership of these dicastaries until his 80th birthday.\nOn 31 October 2006 Pope Benedict appointed Cardinal Hummes to head the Congregation for the Clergy, succeeding Dar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Economic issues\nCardinal Hummes has criticized the spread of global capitalism, claiming that privatizing state companies and lowering tariffs had contributed to \"misery and poverty affecting millions around the world\".[2]\n[edit] Indigenous people\nHe issued an official statement condemning the anonymous attacks on homeless indigenous people. He said \"such violence and cruelty is unacceptable and should be vigorously repudiated. The Church has cried out many times regarding the need to come to the aid of those who are forced to live in our streets, without shelter. She does so out of a duty of humanity and because of her faith in Jesus Christ, who wishes to be identified in each person, especially in the poor and handicapped\".[3]\n[edit] Clerical celibacy\nIn a 2006 interview with Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, Cardinal Hummes said that \u201ceven though celibacy is part of Catholic history and culture, the Church could review this question, because celibacy is not a dogma but a disciplinary question.\u201d He also said that it is \"a long and valuable tradition in the Latin-rite church, based on strong theological and pastoral arguments\".[4]\n[edit] Contraception\nSee also: Roman Catholic Church and AIDS\nHummes has reprimanded priests who attack Catholic teachings about condoms.[2][5]\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nJorge Marcos de Oliveira\nBishop of Santo Andr\u00e9\n1975\u20141996\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nD\u00e9cio Pereira\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAlo\u00edsio Lorscheider\nArchbishop of Fortaleza\n1996\u20141998\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nJos\u00e9 Aparecido Tosi Marques\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nPaulo Evaristo Arns\nArchbishop of S\u00e3o Paulo\n15 April 1998\u201431 October 2006\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nOdilo Scherer\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nDar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos\nPrefect for the Congregation for the Clergy\n31 October 2006\u20147 October 2010\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nMauro Piacenza\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nDar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos\nPresident for the International Council for Catechesis\n31 October 2006\u20147 October 2010\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nMauro Piacenza\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Cardinal Title S.

After studying at the seminary in Villa Devoto, he entered the Society of Jesus on March 11, 1958. Bergoglio obtained a licentiate in philosophy from the Colegio M\u00e1ximo San Jos\u00e9 in San Miguel, and then taught literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada in Santa Fe, and the Colegio del Salvador in Buenos Aires. He was ordained to the priesthood on December 13, 1969 by Archbishop Ram\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 Castellano. He was attending the Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel, a seminary in San Miguel. Eventually, Bergoglio attained the position of novice master there and became professor of theology.\nImpressed with his leadership skills, the Society of Jesus promoted Bergoglio and he served as provincial for Argentina from 1973 to 1979. He was later transferred in 1980 to become the rector of his seminary alma mater. He served in that capacity until 1986. He flew to Germany to complete his doctoral dissertation and returned to his homeland to serve as confessor and spiritual director in C\u00f3rdoba.\n[edit] Episcopacy\nGenerally a rarity for a Jesuit in non-missionary countries, Bergoglio became Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires and was appointed to the titular see of historical Auca. He was consecrated to the episcopacy on June 27, 1992. When it was becoming clear that Antonio Quarracino would soon end his term in office, Bergoglio was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Buenos Aires on February 28, 1998. He effectively took over the duties of the ailing Cardinal Quarracino.\n\n\nStyles of\nJorge Mario Bergoglio\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nBuenos Aires\n\n\nWhen Cardinal Quarracino departed from service, Bergoglio succeeded him on February 28, 1998. He was concurrently named ordinary for Eastern Catholics in Argentina, who lacked their own prelate. Pope John Paul II summoned the newly named archbishop to the consistory of February 21, 2001 in Vatican City. There, the pope elevated Bergoglio with the papal honors of a cardinal. He was named to the Cardinal-Priest of Saint Robert Bellarmino.\n[edit] Cardinal\n\n\n\n\nJorge Cardinal Bergoglio greets President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, December, 2007.\n\n\nAs cardinal, Bergoglio was appointed to several administrative positions in the Roman Curia. He served on the Congregation of Clergy, Congregation of Divine Worship and Sacraments, Congregation of Institutes of Consecrated Life and the Congregation of Societies of Apostolic Life. Bergoglio became a member of the Commission on Latin American and the Family Council.\nAs Cardinal, Bergoglio has become known for personal humility, doctrinal conservatism and a commitment to social justice. A simple lifestyle has contributed to his reputation for humility. He lives in a small apartment, rather than in the palatial bishop's residence. He gave up his chauffeured limousine in favor of public transportation, and he reportedly cooks his own meals.\nUpon the death of Pope John Paul II, Bergoglio was summoned to Vatican City to participate in the 2005 papal conclave as a cardinal elector. Although Bergoglio was considered papabile himself, the conclave selected Pope Benedict XVI. Earlier, he had participated in the funeral of Pope John Paul II and acted as a regent alongside the College of Cardinals, governing the Holy See and the Roman Catholic Church during the interregnum sede vacante period. Cardinal Bergoglio remains eligible to participate in any future conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on December 17, 2016.\nDuring the 2005 Synod of Bishops, he was elected member of the Post-Synodal council. Catholic journalist John L. Allen, Jr. reported that Bergoglio had been a frontrunner in the 2005 Conclave. An unauthorized diary of uncertain authenticity released in September 2005 (1) further affirmed that Bergogolio was the runner-up and main challenger of Cardinal Ratzinger during the conclave. The purported diary of the anonymous cardinal claimed Bergoglio received 40 votes during the third ballot, but fell back to 26 at the fourth and decisive ballot.\nOn November 8, 2005, Bergoglio was elected President of the Argentine Episcopal Conference for a three-year term (2005\u20132008) by a large majority of the Argentine bishops, which according to reports confirms his local leadership and the international prestige earned by his alleged performance in the conclave. Reelected on November 11, 2008.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Liberation theology\nBergoglio is an accomplished theologian who distanced himself from liberation theology early in his career. He is thought to be close to Comunione e Liberazione, a conservative lay movement.\n[edit] Abortion and euthanasia\nCardinal Bergoglio has invited his clergy and laity to oppose both abortion and euthanasia.[1]\n[edit] Homosexuality\nHe has affirmed church teaching on homosexuality, though he teaches the importance of respecting individuals who are gay. He strongly opposed legislation introduced in 2010 by the Argentine Government to allow same-sex marriage. In a letter to the monasteries of Buenos Aires, he wrote: \"Let's not be naive, we're not talking about a simple political battle; it is a destructive pretension against the plan of God. We are not talking about a mere bill, but rather a machination of the Father of Lies that seeks to confuse and deceive the children of God.\" He has also insisted that gay adoption is a form of discrimination against children. This received a rebuke from the Argentine president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who said the church's tone was reminiscent of \"medieval times and the Inquisition\".[2]\n[edit] Church and AIDS\nMain article: Roman Catholic Church and AIDS\nHis doctrinal orthodoxy emphasizes Christ's mandate to love: he is well remembered for his 2001 visit to a hospice, in which he washed and kissed the feet of twelve AIDS patients.\n[edit] Social justice\nHe consistently preaches a message of compassion towards the poor, but somewho? observers would like him to place a greater emphasis on issues of social justice. Rather than articulating positions on matters of political economy, Bergoglio prefers to emphasize spirituality and holiness, believing that this will naturally lead to greater concern for the suffering of the poor. He has, however, voiced support for social programs, and publicly challenged free-market policies.\n[edit] Relations with the Argentine government\nSee also: Dirty War\nOn April 15, 2005, a human rights lawyer filed a criminal complaint against Bergoglio, accusing him of conspiring with the junta in 1976 to kidnap two Jesuit priests, whom he, as superior of the Society of Jesus of Argentina in 1976 had asked to leave their pastoral work following conflict within the Society over how to respond to the new military dictatorship, with some priests advocating a violent overthrow. Bergoglio's spokesman has flatly denied the allegations. No hard evidence was presented linking the cardinal to this crime.

He later served two terms as rector of the same university (1988\u201396) and is the author of a number of books and scholarly articles.\n[edit] Appointed bishop\nOn 26 May 1978 Policarpo was appointed titular bishop of Caliabria and auxiliary bishop of Lisbon, receiving episcopal ordination on 29 June. On 5 March 1997 he was appointed Coadjuctor Archbishop of Lisbon and succeeded Cardinal Ant\u00f3nio Ribeiro as Patriarch on 24 March 1998. Cardinal Policarpo is also Grand Chancellor of the Portuguese Catholic University and he was President of the Portuguese Episcopal Conference.\n[edit] Cardinalate\nHe was created and proclaimed Cardinal by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001, as Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Antonio in Campo Marzio (St. Anthony in the Field of Mars). Cardinal da Cruz Policarpo is a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education, Pontifical Council for the Laity, and Pontifical Council for Culture in the Roman Curia.\nUpon the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Policarpo was considered to be papabile \u2013 a possible successor to the papacy. On 11 April 2005, British newspaper The Guardian considered him to be \"a dark-horse candidate for pope, capable of bridging the divide between the Europeans and the Latin American Roman Catholic cardinals\". The 2005 papal conclave, in which he participated as a cardinal elector, ultimately elected Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Controversies\n[edit] Pro-choice politicians\nHis refusal to excommunicate those who called themselves Catholics and who openly supported legalization of abortion was also criticized by many pro-life Catholics for being one the main reasons of the legalization of abortion in Portugal, in 2007. However, he did not openly deny the right to the Portuguese Roman Catholic priests to refuse them communion, which many in fact did.[1] Portuguese President An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva who chose not to veto the law that legalized abortion in Portugal is a Roman Catholic, but he was never openly criticized by Jos\u00e9 Policarpo for his attitude.\n[edit] Marriages with Muslim men\nOn 14 January 2009, the cardinal directed a warning to young women to \"think twice\" before marrying Muslim men: Christians should learn more about Islam and respect Muslims, but marrying a Muslim man is getting into a lot of trouble, that not even Allah knows where it would end, if the couple moved to an Islamic country.[2][3][4] He also said that dialogue \"with our Muslim brothers\" is difficult, because it is possible to dialogue only with those who want to have dialogue.[2] Human rights group Amnesty International criticized Policarpo for inciting \"discrimination\" and \"intolerance\", and a representative of the Muslim community in Portugal said they were hurt and surprised by his words, but remarked that his words could be interpreted as a call to respect differences and get to know the other religion.[5] A spokesman for the Portuguese Episcopal Conference said the cardinal had offered \"realistic advice\" rather than \"discrimination\" or \"contempt for another culture or religion\".[3]\n[edit] Ordination of women\nCardinal da Cruz Policarpo in June 2011 stated in a magazine interview that, while there is no fundamental theological obstacle to ordination of women, there is, in fact, an obstacle regarding the strong tradition dating from Jesus. There will certainly be no change in our lifetime, he said, and so the question ought not to be raised \u2013 it provokes many reactions.[6][7] Nearly two weeks after giving the interview, he issued a clarification of his comments, in which he unequivocally reaffirmed the teaching of Pope John Paul II in Ordinatio Sacerdotalis.[8]\n[edit] See also\n\nCollege of Cardinals\nList of Cardinals from Portugal\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ [1]\n^ a b Portugal cardinal warns of marriage with Muslims (Reuters, 14 January 2009)\n^ a b (Der Spiegel, 15 January 2009)\n^ Portuguese Church: 'Think twice about marrying Muslims' (Daily Mail, 15 January 2009)\n^ Controversy over Christian-Muslim marriages in Portugal (Trend, Azerbaijan, 15 January 2009)\n^ \"N\u00e3o foi por acaso que Jesus escolheu para ap\u00f3stolos homens e deu \u00e0s mulheres outro tipo de aten\u00e7\u00e3o [...] teol\u00f3gicamente n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nenhum obst\u00e1culo fundamental [...] O problema p\u00f5e-se noutra \u00f3tica, numa forte tradi\u00e7\u00e3o, que vem desde Jesus [...] N\u00e3o \u00e9 com certeza para a nossa vida, hoje ent\u00e3o, no momento que estamos a viver, \u00e9 um daqueles problemas que \u00e9 melhor n\u00e3o levantar...suscita uma s\u00e9rie de rea\u00e7\u00f5es\" (Text of the interview, in Portuguese).\n^ The Patriarch of Lisbon: \"There are no theological reasons for excluding women from the priesthood\" (La Stampa, 25 June 2011)\n^ Statement from the Patriarchate of Lisbon\n\n\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAnt\u00f3nio Ribeiro\nPatriarch of Lisbon\n1998\u2013present\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 51432678\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nPolicarpo, Jose Da Cruz\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n26 February 1936\n\n\nPlace of birth\nAlvorninha, Portugal\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6499/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 35357/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 28426/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 9280/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1687656-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130227221732 ", "Name": "Jos\u00e9 Policarpo"}, {"url": "/wiki/Severino_Poletto", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Severino Poletto\n\n\nCardinal-Archbishop Emeritus of Turin\n\n\nAppointed\n19 June 1999\n\n\nPredecessor\nGiovanni Saldarini\n\n\nSuccessor\nCesare Nosiglia\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of S.

He was the younger of two sons; Pietro, his elder brother, died in 1983. He attended high school at the Manzoni Lyceum in Lecco,[3] where he participated in the youth movement Giovent\u00f9 Studentesca (Student Youth).\nHe studied philosophy at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart from 1964 to 1967, obtaining his doctorate with a dissertation on Christian philosophy. During this time served as Vice-President and thereafter President of the Milanese diocesan chapter of the Federazione Universitaria Cattolica Italiana, the university student wing of Catholic Action.\nAt the university Scola met Luigi Giussani, the founder of the Catholic movement Communion and Liberation. After earning his decree in philosophy and have taught in high schools, Scola decided to became a priest and entered in the Archiepiscopal seminary of Milan, studying one year in Saronno and the others in Venegono. In 1969 Scola asked to the Seminary of Venegono to be ordained Subdeacon ahead of time but he was not allowed to. Following the advice of Luigi Giussani, in summer 1969 Scola moved to the seminary of the Diocese of Teramo-Atri where he studied one year.[4] On 18 July 1970 Scola was ordained to the priesthood in Teramo by Bishop Abele Conigli.\nHe then attained a second doctorate in theology from the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. He wrote his dissertation on the works of St. Thomas Aquinas. An active collaborator in the Communion and Liberation movement from the early 1970s, Scola was the Italian editor of the journal Communio founded by Henri de Lubac, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Joseph Ratzinger (later to become Pope Benedict XVI).[3] He conducted book-length interviews with de Lubac and von Balthasar.[3]\nAfter periods of study in Munich and Paris and time spent in pastoral work, Scola returned to Fribourg to work as research assistant to the chair of political philosophy at Friburg from 1979 and thereafter Assistant Professor of Fundamental Moral Theology, a position he held until 1982 when he was appointed Professor of Theological Anthropology at the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family in Rome and Professor of Contemporary Christology at the Pontifical Lateran University.\nHe founded the Studium Generale Marcianum, an academic institute, and the journal Oasis, published in Italian, English, French, Arabic and Urdu as an outreach to Christians in the Muslim world.[3]\nFrom 1986 to 1991 Scola served the Roman Curia as consultor to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. At the various institutes where he taught he promoted the establishment of bursaries to enable foreign students, particularly those from poorer countries, to study in Italy.\n[edit] Bishop of Grosseto\nScola was named Bishop of Grosseto on 18 July 1991, and was consecrated by Cardinal Bernardin Gantin (with Bishops Abele Conigli and Adelmo Tacconi serving as co-consecrators) on the following 21 September. As Bishop of Grosseto he promoted a renewal of catechesis in the diocese. Scola chose as his episcopal motto Sufficit gratia tua (\"Your grace suffices\", 2 Corinthians 12:9).\nAmong Scola's chief pastoral concerns in Grosseto were the education of children and youths, vocations and clergy formation (he reopened the diocesan seminary), new approaches to parish life, the pastoral care of labourers (particularly during the difficult period of the dismantling of mines in Grosseto), culture and the family, and the opening of a diocesan mission in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. During this period he wrote and published a book aimed at young people on the subject of the educative mission of the Church. In his pastoral capacity as bishop, Scola paid particular attention to the issues of education, youth, clergy formation, renewal of parish life, pastoral care of workers, culture and the family.\n[edit] Rector of Lateran University and offices in Roman Curia\n\n\n\n\nArms of Cardinal Scola of Venice\n\n\nScola in 1995 resigned as bishop of Grosseto to serve as rector of the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome and President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family in Rome, with a term spent as visiting professor at the counterpart Institute in Washington, D.C., during which time he wrote a monograph on the theology of von Balthasar.\nIn 1995 he became a member of the Congregation for the Clergy. He also served as member of the Episcopal Commission for Catholic Education of the Italian Bishops' Conference and, from 1996, as president of the Committee for Institutes of Religious Studies which addresses questions of the theological formation of the laity in Italy.\nFrom 1996 to 2001 Scola was a member of the Pontifical Council for Health Workers and wrote several texts on issues around health care. In 1996 he was named a member to the Pontifical Council for the Family.\nOn 17 January 2009 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture by Pope Benedict.[5] On 5 January 2011 he was appointed among the first members of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.[6] He is also a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship.\n[edit] Patriarch of Venice\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Scola blessing the faithful with the Blessed Sacrament in Venice, 2005.\n\n\nScola was appointed Patriarch of Venice on 5 January 2002, elected President of the Bishops' Conference of the Triveneta region on 9 April 2002 and created Cardinal-Priest of Santi XII Apostoli on 21 October 2003. As patriarch Scola developed a reputation of openness and pastoral concern. In Venice, for instance, he set aside Wednesday mornings to meet anyone who wanted to see him, whether or not they had an appointment.[7]\nAfter the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Scola was considered to be among the papabili in the 2005 papal conclave.[3] Sr\u0111a Trifkovi\u0107 supported him vigorously in Chronicles because he saw him as the only man who might reverse what Vatican insiders see as the decay of European culture. The conclave elected Joseph Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Archbishop of Milan\nOn 28 June 2011 he was appointed to replace Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi as Archbishop of Milan, and he left the office of Patriarch of Venice.

His father was Esan and his mother was Yoruba. Okogie was ordained as a priest on 11 December 1966. He holds a licentiate in sacred theology, and had planned to study in Rome, but was called to Nigeria where he was a pastoral assistant at the Holy Cross Cathedral. He was drafted into the Nigerian army, and served there as a chaplain. After another period of service at Holy Cross Cathedral, he was an instructor at King's College.\nIn 1971, he was ordained titular Bishop of Mascula and Auxiliary of Oyo, and in 1973 named Archbishop. As Archbishop, Okogie was the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, and, from 1994 to 2000, headed the Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria.\nCardinal Okogie volunteered to die in place of a Muslim woman who had been condemned to death by stoning by an Islamic court for adultery.[1]\nHe was proclaimed Cardinal by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 October 2003, and holds the title of Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria del Monte Carmelo a Mostacciano (or in English Blessed Virgin Mary of Mt. Carmel of Mostacciano). During his cardinalate, Okogie was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nHis resignation from the pastoral governance of the see of Lagos because of having reached the age limit of 75 years was accepted on 25 May 2012.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Views\n\n1.1 Condoms\n1.2 Celibacy\n1.3 American culture\n\n\n2 References\n3 External links\n\n3.1 References\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Condoms\nIn 2007, he condemned the government approval of a condom factory.[2]\n[edit] Celibacy\nCardinal Okogie has defended the Catholic Church's laws on celibacy for Catholic priests.[3]\n[edit] American culture\nOkogie has been critical of American culture, especially as it relates to priestly vocations.

Pope John Paul created and proclaimed Archbishop Amigo Vallejo Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli in the consistory of 21 October 2003. He participated in the Papal conclave in 2005, which elected Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI.\nOn 5 November 2009, Cardinal Amigo Vallejo retired as Archbishop of Seville and was succeeded by Juan Asenjo Pelegrina.\nOn Saturday, 22 September 2012, Cardinal Amigo Vallejo was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI to serve as his Special Envoy to the closing celebrations of the fifth centenary (500-year-anniversary) of the arrival of Puerto Rico's first Bishop, Don Alonso Manso, set to take place in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on November 19, 2012.[1]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/29701.php?index=29701&lang=en\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to: Carlos Amigo Vallejo\n\n\n\nBiography at catholic-pages.com\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nJos\u00e9 Maria Bueno y Monreal\nArchbishop of Seville\n22 May 1982 \u2013 5 November 2009\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nJuan Asenjo Pelegrina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 60476725\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nAmigo Vallejo, Carlos\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n23 August 1934\n\n\nPlace of birth\nMedina de Rioseco, Spain\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6312/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 34433/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 31028/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 9966/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1800068-0!*!0!!*!4!* and timestamp 20130227224655 ", "Name": "Carlos Amigo Vallejo"}, {"url": "/wiki/Justin_Francis_Rigali", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Justin Francis Rigali\n\n\nCardinal-Archbishop Emeritus of Philadelphia\n\n\n\n\n\nAppointed\nJuly 15, 2003\n\n\nEnthroned\nOctober 7, 2003\n\n\nReign ended\nJuly 19, 2011\n\n\nPredecessor\nAnthony Bevilacqua\n\n\nSuccessor\nCharles Chaput, OFM Cap\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of S.

In October of that year, he entered the graduate division of the Pontifical North American College in Rome, later obtaining a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1964.[2] He was also an assistant during the first two sessions (1962\u20131963) of the Second Vatican Council.[4] Rigali briefly returned to the United States in the summer of 1964, during which time he served as a associate pastor in Pomona.[2] Returning to Rome, he then studied at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy from 1964 to 1966 in preparation for his diplomatic work for the Vatican.\nRigali began his service in the English section of the Secretariat of State on November 25, 1964.[4] From September 1966 to February 1970, he was secretary of the Apostolic Nunciature to Madagascar, which also served as the apostolic delegation for the islands of R\u00e9union and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. He was named a Papal Chamberlain on July 11, 1967. On February 11, 1970, Rigali became director of the English section of the Secretariat of State and the English translator to the Servant of God Pope Paul VI, whom Rigali subsequently accompanied on several international trips.[4]\nDuring his service at the Secretariat of State, Rigali was also a chaplain at a Carmelite monastery and a professor at his alma mater of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy.[2] He accompanied Pope John Paul II on a number of international pastoral visits, including his first two journeys to the United States in 1979 (which included a trip to Rigali's future see of Philadelphia) and 1987. He was made a Prelate of Honor of His Holiness on April 19, 1980, and a magistral chaplain in the Order of the Knights of Malta on October 25, 1984.[4]\n[edit] Episcopal career\nOn June 8, 1985, Rigali was appointed President of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy and Titular Archbishop of Volsinium by Pope John Paul II.[3] He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 14 from Pope John Paul himself, with Archbishops Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Somalo and Achille Silvestrini as co-consecrators, in the cathedral of Albano.[3] He selected as his episcopal motto: Verbum Caro Factum Est, meaning, \"The Word Became Flesh\" (John 1:14). He became a member of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre on October 13, 1986.[4]\nFrom 1985 to 1990, in addition to his role of President of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, Rigali held a number of positions within the Roman Curia, serving in the Secretariat of State, Council for the Public Affairs of the Church, Congregation for Bishops, and Pontifical Council for the Laity.[2] He was named Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops by John Paul II on December 21, 1989; as Secretary, he served as the second-highest official of that dicastery. Rigali was later made Secretary of the College of Cardinals by John Paul II on January 2, 1990, and served on the Permanent Interdicasterial Commission, Pontifical Commission for Latin America, and Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. During the same time, he was also engaged in pastoral service to a number of parishes and seminaries in Rome.[2]\n[edit] Archbishop of St. Louis\nOn January 25, 1994, Pope John Paul II named Rigali the seventh Archbishop of St. Louis, Missouri. Succeeding Archbishop John L. May, he was formally installed by Bernardin Cardinal Gantin, then the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Bishops, on March 15 of that same year.[3] The newly-installed Archbishop Rigali became a member of the Knights of Columbus on November 7, 1994. During his tenure at St. Louis, once known as the \"Rome of the West,\" Archbishop Rigali showed a great interest in schools, visiting every high school in the archdiocese.[5] However, Archbishop Rigali opposed collective bargaining by teachers, and opposed any efforts they made to organize. Archbishop Rigali was widely credited as an able administrator and effective fundraiser, although his popularity dimmed as his tenure continued.[5]\nIn January 1999, Archbishop Rigali hosted the pastoral visit of Pope John Paul to St. Louis, the only such visit to a single diocese in the United States during the pontificate.[5] John Paul reportedly decided to be hosted by the Archdiocese of St. Louis because of his longtime close friendship with Rigali.[5]\n[edit] Archbishop of Philadelphia\nSee also: Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Philadelphia\nRigali was later appointed the eighth Archbishop of Philadelphia by Pope John Paul II toward the end of his pontificate on July 15, 2003.[3] He replaced the retiring Anthony Bevilacqua, who praised his successor as \"a man...known for his loyalty to the Holy Father and for his unwavering fidelity to the teachings of the Church.\"[6] Prior to Archbishop Rigali's installation in Philadelphia on October 7, 2003, it was announced on September 28 that he would be elevated to the College of Cardinals, a customary privilege for the archbishops of Philadelphia. Archbishop Rigali was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prisca in the consistory of October 21, 2003.\nCardinal Rigali was the only American cardinal to serve as a concelebrant at the 2005 funeral mass for John Paul II. He was also one of the cardinal electors who participated in the ensuing papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Rigali remains eligible to vote in any future conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on April 19, 2015.\nIn September 2007, the Cardinal was named by Pope Benedict XVI as a member of the Congregation for Bishops, the curia department that puts forward to the Pope the names of those considered to be appropriate choices to be appointed as bishops.\nCardinal Rigali turned 75 in 2010, the age at which Bishops (or Cardinals) must submit a letter of resignation to the Pope, although it is not required to be accepted at that time.\nOn June 16, 2011, the Cardinal was appointed Pope Benedict XVI's special envoy to the celebrations at Prachatice in the Czech Republic for the 200th anniversary of the birth of Saint John Neumann, the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia and thus Rigali's predecessor. Neumann, the second American citizen to be canonized (after St. Frances Xavier Cabrini), was born in Prachatice, came to the United States and was ordained there in 1836, and in 1848 became a naturalized United States citizen.[7]\nIt was announced on July 19, 2011 that Denver Archbishop Charles J. Chaput would succeed Rigali in his position as Archbishop of Philadelphia. Chaput's installation took place on September 8, 2011.[8] Rigali served as the Apostolic Administrator of Philadelphia until Chaput's official installation.[9] After the installation, Cardinal Rigali will begin his time of retirement in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Knoxville, Tennessee, where he has been invited to live (the current Bishop of Knoxville, Richard Stika, served as a Vicar General and Chancellor of the Archdiocese of St. Louis when Cardinal Rigali was the Archbishop there from 1994 to 2003).\n[edit] Apostolic Administrator of Scranton\nOn August 31, 2009, Cardinal Rigali became the Apostolic Administrator (sede vacante) to the Diocese of Scranton following the Pope's acceptance of the resignations of Bishop Joseph Martino and Bishop John Dougherty, Auxiliary Bishop of Scranton. Rigali served eight months as the Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Scranton. His delegate was Joseph C. Bambera, who became the tenth Bishop of Scranton on April 26, 2010, bringing Rigali's administration of Scranton to an end.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Gay marriage\nIn June 2006, Cardinal Rigali traveled to the White House along with Archbishop John J. Myers of Newark and Cardinal Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley of Boston to attend a press conference by President George W. Bush to support a constitutional amendment initiative in the U.S. Senate banning gay unions or marriages.\n[edit] Abortion\nAs chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Pro-Life Committee, he remarked during the annual Washington, D.C. pro-life rally in January 2007 that \"there are reasons for rejoicing\" in the pro-life cause: the growing participation by young people and a heightened awareness of the issue's intense and growing moral sensitivity among them, who will eventually have a contribution to make to societal issues. He has publicly endorsed the Pregnant Women Support Act, which he praised for offering \"an authentic common ground\" that \"will proved many kinds of life-affirming support for pregnant women and their unborn children.\"[10]\nHe was the principal celebrant at the Vigil Mass for the March for Life on January 21, 2009.[11]\nHe said that the decision by the University of Notre Dame to have President Obama deliver the commencement speech at its graduation ceremony and receive an honorary degree was \"most unfortunate\" and the reasoning behind it \"evades common sense.\"[12]\n[edit] Conscience rights\nIn November 2009, Cardinal Rigali, with several other Roman Catholic prelates, signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration, which stated:\n\nBecause the sanctity of human life, the dignity of marriage as a union of husband and wife and the freedom of conscience and religion are foundational principles of justice and the common good, we are compelled by our Christian faith to speak and act in their defense. In this declaration we affirm:\n\nthe profound, inherent, and equal dignity of every human being as a creature fashioned in the very image of God, possessing inherent rights of equal dignity and life;\nmarriage as a conjugal union of man and woman, ordained by God from the creation, and historically understood by believers and non-believers alike, to be the most basic institution in society and;\nreligious liberty, which is grounded in the character of God, the example of Christ, and the inherent freedom and dignity of human beings created in the divine image.[13]\n\n\nand declared:\n\nWe are Christians who have joined together across historic lines of ecclesial differences to affirm our right\u2014and, more importantly, to embrace our obligation\u2014to speak and act in defense of these truths. We pledge to each other, and to our fellow believers, that no power on earth, be it cultural or political, will intimidate us into silence or acquiescence.\n\nThrough the centuries, Christianity has taught that civil disobedience is not only permitted, but sometimes required. There is no more eloquent defense of the rights and duties of religious conscience than the one offered by Martin Luther King, Jr., in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail. Writing from an explicitly Christian perspective, and citing Christian writers such as Augustine and Aquinas, King taught that just laws elevate and ennoble human beings because they are rooted in the moral law whose ultimate source is God Himself.[13]\n\n[edit] Stem cell research\nIn March 2009, he described President Barack Obama's lifting of George W. Bush's restrictions on embryonic stem cell research as \"a sad victory of politics over science and ethics.\"[14]\n[edit] Ordination of women\nIn April 2009, he denounced the ordination ceremony of two women in Roxborough, calling it a \"pseudo-ordination\" that \"denigrates the truth entrusted to the Church by Christ himself.\"[15][dead link]\n[edit] Communications\nHe has a weekly series of Lenten discourses on YouTube. In the beginning of 2010 an official Facebook page was launched for Cardinal Rigali.\n[edit] Charity work\nHe is an honorary council member of the St. Louis, Missouri based humanitarian organization Wings of Hope.[16]\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nPope John Paul II\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nEdward Kenneth Braxton\nMay 17, 1995\n\n\nJohn Raymond Gaydos\nAugust 27, 1997\n\n\nMichael John Sheridan\nSeptember 3, 1997\n\n\nJoseph Fred Naumann\nSeptember 3, 1997\n\n\nTimothy Michael Dolan\nAugust 15, 2001\n\n\nRobert Joseph Hermann\nDecember 12, 2002\n\n\nLawrence Eugene Brandt\nMarch 4, 2004\n\n\nJoseph Robert Cistone\nJuly 28, 2004\n\n\nJoseph Patrick McFadden\nJuly 28, 2004\n\n\nKevin Carl Rhoades\nDecember 9, 2004\n\n\nDaniel Edward Thomas\nJuly 26, 2006\n\n\nRichard Frank Stika\nMarch 19, 2009\n\n\nTimothy C.

In response to demands that the Church denounce divorcees who were candidates for political office in the 1990s, he said the Church should be more concerned with their voting record.[4] When in 2009 the Italian Court of Cassation declared there was no substantial difference in law between a family based on marriage and one resulting from cohabitation, he reacted by saying that, in the light of recent sociological studies that reveal the benefits to society of what is called the traditional family and the disadvantages for society of single-parent families and those of cohabiting couples, the traditional family is needed more than ever today both for family members and for society as a whole.[5]\nIn January 2012 Bishop Demetrio Fernandez of Cordoba said there was a conspiracy by the United Nations. \"The Minister for Family of the Papal Government, Cardinal Antonelli, told me a few days ago in Zaragoza that UNESCO has a program for the next 20 years to make half the world population homosexual. To do this they have distinct programs, and will continue to implant the ideology that is already present in our schools.\"[6]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Nomina del Presidente del Pontificio Consiglio per la Famiglia\" (in Italian).

He is the president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace since his appointment by Pope Benedict XVI on 24 October 2009. He had served as Archbishop of Cape Coast. He was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope John Paul II in 2003,[1] and is widely regarded as papabile.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and priesthood\n2 Episcopal career\n3 Roman Curia\n4 Papabile coverage\n5 Views\n\n5.1 Black man as pope\n5.2 HIV/AIDS and condoms\n5.3 Reform of the international financial system\n5.4 Homosexuality\n5.5 Sex abuse scandals\n\n\n6 See also\n7 References\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and priesthood\nTurkson was born in Wassa Nsuta in Western Ghana to a Methodist mother and a Catholic father.[6] He is the fourth child among ten children. His mother sold vegetables in the open market while his father worked as a carpenter. He had a paternal uncle who was a Muslim.[7] He studied at St. Teresa's Seminary in the village of Amisano and Pedu before attending St. Anthony-on-Hudson Seminary in Rensselaer, New York, where he graduated as a Master of Theology. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop John Amissah on 20 July 1975.\nTurkson was a professor at St Teresa's Minor Seminary from 1975 to 1976, whence he entered the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, earning a licentiate in Sacred Scripture in 1980. He returned to St Teresa's for a year, 1980\u201381, and became vice-rector at St Peter's Seminary in 1981. He also did pastoral work in a parish annexed to the seminary. From 1987 to 1992, he did doctoral studies in Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute.\n[edit] Episcopal career\nOn 6 October 1992, Turkson was appointed Archbishop of Cape Coast by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on 27 March 1993 from Archbishop Dominic Kodwo Andoh, with Archbishops Peter Poreku Dery and Peter Kwasi Sarpong serving as co-consecrators. He served as President of the Ghana Catholic Bishops' Conference from 1997 to 2005, and as Chancellor of the Catholic University College of Ghana since 2003.\nJohn Paul II created Turkson Cardinal-Priest of S. Liborio in his final consistory of 21 October 2003. Turkson is the first Ghanaian cardinal and was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the papal conclave of 2005 which elected Pope Benedict XVI. He was described as \"one of Africa's most energetic church leaders\" by The Tablet, a Roman Catholic magazine published in London.[8]\n[edit] Roman Curia\nOn 24 October 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Turkson President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.[9] Within the Roman Curia, Turkson is also a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church and, since 4 March 2010, the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses.[10] On 12 June 2012 Cardinal Turkson was appointed a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education[11]\nOn 16 October 2010 Pope Benedict appointed him as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith[12] These memberships are for five years and are renewable. Being resident in Rome, Turkson is invited to attend not only the plenary meetings of those departments, which in principle are held every year, but also the ordinary meetings.\nCardinal Turkson delivered the plenary address of the 2011 Catholic Social Ministry Gathering. The gathering, in Washington D.C. on the theme of \u201cProtecting Human Life and Dignity: Promoting a Just Economy,\u201d is sponsored by 19 Catholic organizations, including the U.S. Catholic bishops. In a recent interview with CNA, Turkson said he has learned from past experience that the Church\u2019s justice and peace terminology often needs clarification for an American Catholic audience. Key terms used by the Vatican \u2014 such as \u201csocial justice\u201d and \u201cgift\u201d \u2014 are not always understood the way the Vatican intends, he said. \"We found out that some of the vocabulary which is just taken for granted and used freely may not always have the same sense or may have had some nuances which sometimes are missed because of the way the terms are used in the American political context,\u201d Cardinal Turkson said in an interview on 12 January at the council\u2019s offices in Rome. Pope Benedict XVI appointed Cardinal Turkson to his post in October 2009, just months after the Pope released his blueprint for the Church\u2019s social teaching, Caritas in Veritate.[13]\nOn 10 March 2011, Cardinal Turkson gave a lecture in Durham, England, organised by the Durham University Centre for Catholic Studies and the Catholic Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle in honour of the late Bishop Kevin Dunn who was instrumental in the creation of the Centre.\nOn 30 March 2011, Pope Benedict XVI announced at his weekly general audience that he was sending Cardinal Turkson as a Vatican mediator to contribute to a possible diplomatic, non-military solution to the potentially explosive civil conflict in Ivory Coast, which could turn into an even bloodier civil war if not contained. There Laurent Gbagbo had refused, in spite of international condemnation and local protests and resistance, to step aside and hand over power to Alassane Ouattara, the certified winner of the presidential election. Atrocities have been committed by both sides.[14]\nIn October 2011 Cardinal Turkson called for the establishment of a \u201cglobal public authority\u201d and a \u201ccentral world bank\u201d to rule over financial institutions that have become outdated and often ineffective in dealing fairly with crises. The document, Towards Reforming the International Financial and Monetary Systems in the Context of a Global Public Authority was very specific, calling for taxation measures on financial transactions. It notes that \u201cThe economic and financial crisis which the world is going through calls everyone, individuals and peoples, to examine in depth the principles and the cultural and moral values at the basis of social coexistence,\u201d it said. The document condemned what it called \u201cthe idolatry of the market\u201d as well as a \u201cneo-liberal thinking\u201d that it said looked exclusively at technical solutions to economic problems. \u201cIn fact, the crisis has revealed behaviours like selfishness, collective greed and hoarding of goods on a great scale,\u201d it said, adding that world economics needed an \u201cethic of solidarity\u201d among rich and poor nations.[15][16]\nIn October 2012 Turkson created some controversy when he showed a YouTube video called \"Muslim Demographics\", which critics labelled as alarmistic at an international conference for bishops.[17]\nAn accomplished polyglot, Turkson is able to speak English, Fante, French, Italian, German, and Hebrew, in addition to understanding Latin and Greek.[18]\n[edit] Papabile coverage\nImmediately following the announcement on 11 February 2013 of the impending resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, at least two bookmakers, Paddy Power and Ladbrokes, made Turkson the favourite to be elected as the new pope,[19] with Paddy Power giving 2/1 odds.[20] Turkson has also been mentioned in regards to St. Malachy's apocalyptic list Prophecy of the Popes, given that its final Pope is named Peter. Odds of 4/1 are given.[21]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Black man as pope\nCardinal Turkson has said that \"if God would wish to see a black man also as pope, thanks be to God\".[22] The Catholic Church chronicler Rocco Palmo called Turkson the lone Scripture scholar in the Pope's \"Senate\" and believes that his status as a potential \"papabile\" has been elevated due to his appointment as spokesman for Second Synod for Africa in 2009.[23] With the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI in 2013, Turkson is seen as a papabile (potential successor)[24] in the upcoming papal conclave. Turkson also joined Twitter in February 2013 @TurksonCardinal, according to a spokesperson to the Cardinal.\n[edit] HIV/AIDS and condoms\nIn 2009, he reaffirmed the Catholic social teaching on contraception, in regard to statements made by Pope Benedict XVI that condoms were not a solution to Africa\u2019s AIDS crisis and were taken out of context by the media.[25] Turkson did not rule out condoms in all circumstances suggesting they could be useful in the situation of a married, faithful couple where one partner is infected; although he warns that, as the quality of condoms in Africa is poor, their use could engender false confidence. He said abstinence, fidelity, and refraining from sex if infected were the key to fighting the epidemic. He also believes that the money being spent on condoms would be better spent providing anti-retroviral drugs to those already infected.[22][26][27]\n[edit] Reform of the international financial system\nIn response to the global economic crisis started in 2008, Cardinal Turkson, together with bishop Mario Toso, elaborated a proposal to reform the international financial system by creating a Global Public Authority and a Global Bank that consider the interest of all developing countries. The document of 40 pages was officially presented in October 2011 and criticizes the current structure of International Monetary Fund and other institutions.[28]\n[edit] Homosexuality\nIn 2012, in response to a speech by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urging Church leaders to do more for human rights and in particular LGBT rights in Africa, Turkson, while recognising that some of the sanctions imposed on homosexuals in Africa are an \u201cexaggeration,\u201d stated that the \u201cintensity of the reaction is probably commensurate with tradition.\u201d \u201cJust as there\u2019s a sense of a call for rights, there\u2019s also a call to respect culture, of all kinds of people,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, if it\u2019s being stigmatized, in fairness, it\u2019s probably right to find out why it is being stigmatized.\u201d He also called for distinction to be made between human rights and moral issues.[29]\n[edit] Sex abuse scandals\nIn February 2013, Turkson stated in an interview that he believes that the Catholic child sex scandals would not spread to Africa in significant proportions. He claimed that \"African traditional systems [...] have protected its population against this tendency\", and went on to say that \"in several cultures in Africa homosexuality or for that matter any affair between two sexes of the same kind are not countenanced\".[30]\n\n[edit] See also\n\nRoman Catholicism in Africa\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Miranda, Salvador. \"Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson\".

Speaking of his decision to become a priest, Pell once said, \"To put it crudely, I feared and suspected and eventually became convinced that God wanted me to do His work, and I was never able to successfully escape that conviction.\"[4][page\u00a0needed]\nIn 1960, he began his priestly studies at Corpus Christi College, then located in Werribee.[1] One of his fellow seminarians at Corpus Christi was Denis Hart, Pell's future successor as Archbishop of Melbourne.[4] Pell continued to play football and served as class prefect in his second and third years.[4][page\u00a0needed] In 1963, he was assigned to continue his studies at the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome.[5] He was ordained to the diaconate on 15 August 1966.[3]\n[edit] Priesthood\nOn 16 December 1966, Pell was ordained a priest by Cardinal Gr\u00e9goire-Pierre Agagianian at St. Peter's Basilica.[2] He received a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Urbaniana University in 1967, and continued his studies at the University of Oxford, where he earned a DPhil in church history in 1971.[3] During his studies at Oxford, he also served as a chaplain to Catholic students at Eton College, where he celebrated the first Roman Catholic Mass since the English Reformation.[4]\nIn 1971, he returned to Australia and was assigned to serve as an assistant priest in Swan Hill, where he remained for two years.[3] He then served at a parish in Ballarat East from 1973 to 1983, becoming administrator of the parish of Bungaree in 1984.[3] In 1982, he earned a Master of Education degree from Monash University in Melbourne.[1] During his tenure in Ballarat East and Bungaree, he also served as Episcopal Vicar for Education (1973\u201384), director of the Aquinas campus of the Institute of Catholic Education (1974\u201384) and principal of the Institute of Catholic Education (1981\u201384).[1] He was also editor of Light, the diocesan newspaper of Ballarat, from 1979 to 1984.[3]\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Pell served as seminary rector of his alma mater, Corpus Christi College.[1]\n[edit] Episcopacy\n\n\n\n\nPatriarch Ignatius Joseph III Yunan with Pell wearing his cardinal's attire\n\n\nPell was appointed an auxiliary bishop of Melbourne and Titular Bishop of Scala on 30 March 1987. He received his episcopal consecration on 21 May 1987 from Archbishop Frank Little, with bishops Ronald Mulkearns and Joseph O'Connell serving as co-consecrators. He served as Bishop for the Southern Region of Melbourne (1987\u201396). During this time, he was a parish priest in Mentone.[1]\nPell was named seventh Archbishop of Melbourne on 16 July 1996, receiving the pallium from Pope John Paul II on 29 June 1997. He was later appointed eighth Archbishop of Sydney on 26 March 2001 and again received the pallium from John Paul on 29 June 2001.\nPell was a consultor of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace from 1990 to 1995 and a member from 2002. From 1990 to 2000 he was a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In April 2002, John Paul II named him President of the Vox Clara commission to advise the Congregation for Divine Worship on English translations of liturgical texts. In December 2002 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for the Family, having previously served as a consultor to the council. On 22 September 2012, Pell was appointed a member of the Congregation for Bishops.\n[edit] Church role\nSince Pell's appointment as Archbishop of Melbourne he has maintained a high public profile on a wide range of issues, while retaining a strict adherence to Catholic orthodoxy; with some dispute over the issue of Catholics and \"primacy of conscience\".[6][7]\nPell worked co-operatively with his Anglican counterpart, Peter Jensen, on political issues while avoiding theological controversies. This was referred to in Sydney as \"the ecumenism of the right\". In defending the importance of religious belief in building a just society, Pell worked with representatives of non-Christian faiths, arguing in 2001 that \"the most significant religious change in Australia over the past 50 years is the increase of people without religion, now about one fifth of the population. All monotheists, Christians and Jews, Muslims and Sikhs, must labour to reverse this. We must not allow the situation to deteriorate as it had in Elijah's time, 850 years before Christ, where monotheism was nearly swamped by the aggressive paganism of the followers of Baal.\"[citation needed]\nOn 28 September 2003 Pope John Paul II announced that he would nominate Pell and 28 others to the College of Cardinals.[8] In the consistory of 21 October he was created and proclaimed Cardinal-Priest of S. Maria Domenica Mazzarello. For the first time ever, from Pell's elevation to the cardinalate in 2003 until Edward Bede Clancy's 80th birthday on 13 December 2003, there were three Australian cardinal electors (had a papal election become necessary), including Clancy and Edward Idris Cassidy, president emeritus of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.\nPell was one of the electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. It has been speculated that Pell served as a type of \"campaign manager\" behind Benedict's election.[9] While there was a little speculation in the Australian media that he had an outside chance of becoming Pope himself, international commentary on the papal succession (aside from one Italian source) did not mention Pell as a contender. However, Pell was mentioned as a possible successor to Benedict XVI as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.[10] This position was given to William Levada, former Archbishop of San Francisco. Pell remains eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on 8 June 2021.\nIn 2006 Pell made a successful bid for Sydney to host the 2008 World Youth Day, one of the largest regular international gatherings of young people in the world, often attracting crowds of millions. The 2008 event brought Pope Benedict XVI on his first papal visit to Australia. \"We take it for granted that people will always give to the poor and be concerned about social justice\", Pell said soon after winning the bid, in remarks which spelled out his pastoral priorities. \"But this doesn't just happen by itself. Many great civilisations have shown no regard for these values at all and have even considered them weaknesses...Every society requires a goodly percentage of active believers to ensure that the values of a fair go and respect for others are promoted, and passed on the next generation. World Youth Day will make a powerful contribution to this vital work\".[citation needed]\nOn 18 September 2012, Pell was named by Pope Benedict XVI to be one of the papally-appointed Synod Fathers for the October 2012 Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization.[11]\n[edit] Views\nIn the Australian context, Pell is regarded as progressive on many social issues but a conservative on matters of faith and morals.[12] He has often been wary of what he calls the \"callousness\" of unrestrained capitalism. He has written that a Catholic is someone who is not only a person of personal conscience but \"is someone who believes Christ is Son of God, accepts His teachings and lives a life of worship, service and duty in the community. Catholics are not created by the accident of birth to remain only because their tribe has an interesting history.\"[13]\n[edit] Theology and worship\n[edit] Ad orientem liturgy\nPell supports, in the abstract but not as a proposal for immediate application, mandatory celebration of the Canon of the Mass with the ad orientem orientation of the priest, facing in the same direction as the congregation. \"There's nothing like a consensus in favour of that at the moment. I think I would be in favour of it because it makes it patently clear that the priest is not the centre of the show, that this an act of worship of the one true God, and the people are joining with the priest for that.\"[14]\n[edit] Adam and Eve\nAsked by an Australian journalist in 2012 whether there had ever been a Garden of Eden scenario with an \"actual\" Adam and Eve, Pell said:[15][16]\n\nAdam and Eve are terms \u2013 what do they mean: life and earth. It\u2019s like every man. That\u2019s a beautiful, sophisticated, mythological account. It\u2019s not science but it\u2019s there to tell us two or three things. First of all that God created the world and the universe. Secondly, that the key to the whole of universe, the really significant thing, are humans and, thirdly, it is a very sophisticated mythology to try to explain the evil and suffering in the world.\n\n[edit] Heaven and Hell\nAsked to describe his concept of Heaven for Australian TV in 2012, Pell said:[15]\n\n[I]n some sense we will be there as continuing persons. In some with a new heaven and a new earth with all the good things that we\u2019ve done will be incorporated into the new heaven and new earth. How it will work out I don't know because, I think, physically and morally and intellectually we're at our peak at different stages in our life. How it will work out I\u2019ve got no idea but that is the general outline of Christian teaching.\n\nAsked about the subject of Hell, Pell said that he used the example of Hitler to explain the notion of a need for Hell: \"You think Hitler might be in hell? Started the Second World War, caused the death of 50 million or would you prefer a system where Hitler got away with it for free?\"\n\nWe Catholics generally believe that there is a hell. I hope nobody is there. I certainly believe in a place of purification. I think it will be like getting up in the morning and you throw the curtains back and the light is just too much. God's light would be too much for us. But I believe on behalf of the innocent victims in history that the scales of justice should work out. And if they don't, life is radically unjust, the law of the jungle prevails.\n\n[edit] Ordination of women and priestly celibacy\nPell supported Pope John Paul II's view that the ordination of women is impossible according to the church's divine constitution and has also expressed his opinion that abandoning the tradition of clerical celibacy would be a \"serious blunder\".[17]\n[edit] Royal Commission on sexual abuse\nIn late 2012, the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. In a televised media conference, Pell welcomed the Royal Commission. However his comments received significant media attention when he stated that priests who hear confessions from people who commit child sex abuse must remain bound by the Seal of Confession, commenting:[18][19][20][21]\n\nIf that is done outside the confessional (it can be reported to the police).... (But) the Seal of Confession is inviolable. If the priest knows beforehand about such a situation, the priest should refuse to hear the confession... That would be my advice, and I would never hear the confession of a priest who is suspected of such a thing.\n\nIn his 2012 Christmas address, Pell stated that he was \"deeply sorry\" for the hurt that had occurred, describing it as \"completely contrary\" to Christ's teachings.[22][23][24]\n[edit] Society of St Pius X\nPell has expressed agreement with the lifting of the excommunication of the four bishops of the Traditionalist Catholic Society of St Pius X (SSPX). He has said that \"I think it is certainly a worthy goal to try to reconcile that wing of the Church\", but also insisted that the SSPX must accept the teachings of the Second Vatican Council before it can be fully reconciled with the Holy See, saying: \"I think it would be quite incongruous wanting to be formally reconciled with the Church if you are explicitly disavowing key elements of Vatican II\", among which he mentioned the teaching that \"the state cannot coerce belief\" and the council's \"condemnation of anti-semitism\".[25]\n[edit] Political issues\n[edit] Afghanistan and Iraq Wars\nPell has written that he supported the Afghanistan War but believed that the Iraq War was \"not morally justified\".[26]\n[edit] Asylum seekers and refugees\nPell has criticised the bipartisan policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers in Australia and called for \"empathy and compassion\" towards displaced peoples.[27] Pell said that while a policy of detterence was justifiable, the practice of the policy was coming at too great a \"moral cost\".[28] Describing conditions in some of Australia's mandatory detention camps in 2001 as \"pretty tight and miserable\" and \"no place for women and children\", Pell called for investigation of any maltreatment of detainees and said that, while Australia has the right to regulate the number of refugees it accepts, as a rich and prosperous country, it can \"afford to be generous\" and must treat refugees who reach Australia humanely.[29]\n[edit] Australian republicanism\nPell was appointed a delegate to the Australian Constitutional Convention 1998 which considered the issue of Australia becoming a republic. Pell supported change, and called on Australia's political leaders to embrace the republic, noting \"Without support from most of the front benches of both sides of the parliament, it would be wasteful to go to a referendum.\" Towards the end of proceedings, he called on conservatives to support change.[30]\n[edit] World leaders\n[edit] John Howard\nWhen John Howard departed the office of Prime Minister of Australia following the 2007 Australian federal election, Pell wrote that, along with Bob Hawke, Howard had been the outstanding figure of Australian life since Robert Menzies and that he had brought 11 years of prosperity and \"changed Australian life for the better\".[31] Pell wrote that Howard \"understood that traditional families are the cement which hold society together and he was generally supportive of Christian values\". Pell said that Howard went a step too far on industrial relations policy and that the Iraq War did not go well, but that the \"biggest blot on his record will remain the treatment of the refugees\".[31]\n[edit] John F. Kennedy\nPell describes himself as \"an old Kennedy groupie\" \u2013 referring to John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic President of the United States.[12]\n[edit] Barack Obama\nFollowing the 2008 election of Barack Obama as US President, Pell wrote for The Sunday Telegraph that \"Obama is a superb orator with a gift for language and a capacity to inspire loyalty and hope\" and that the \"importance of a black President for the U.S.A. and the world cannot be underestimated; especially a black President with a Muslim father. No country in Europe could produce such a result.\"[citation needed] Pell expressed a need for universal health care in the United States, but criticised Obama's support for abortion, saying that he had the \"most anti-life voting record of any contemporary senator\" which, Pell wrote, \"contrasts strongly with his humanitarianism in many other areas\". Pell said that Obama would have to move beyond the \"radical left\" if he wanted to \"win over the middle ground in the fight for healing and prosperity\".[32] In a 2009 interview with The Catholic Herald, Pell said of Obama, \"[H]is record on life issues is very, very bad indeed\" and expressed his opposition to the Freedom of Choice Act.[14]\n[edit] Kevin Rudd\nWhen the Australian Labor Party replaced Kevin Rudd as its leader in 2010 and Julia Gillard became the Prime Minister of Australia, Pell wrote that \"As leaders Rudd and Opposition leader Tony Abbott are historically unusual by Australian standards because both worship regularly and have publicly acknowledged the huge Christian contribution to Australia. The rise and fall of Kevin Rudd has no parallel nationally. While he talked himself out of his job with his inflated rhetoric, he had many virtues and Australia avoided recession. John Howard was voted out by the Australian public; Rudd's departure will leave a nasty taste in many mouths.\"[33]\n[edit] Environmental concerns\nPell aroused criticism from Senator Christine Milne of the Greens political party with the following comment in his 2006 Legatus Summit speech:[34]\n\nSome of the hysteric and extreme claims about global warming are also a symptom of pagan emptiness, of Western fear when confronted by the immense and basically uncontrollable forces of nature. Belief in a benign God who is master of the universe has a steadying psychological effect, although it is no guarantee of Utopia, no guarantee that the continuing climate and geographic changes will be benign. In the past pagans sacrificed animals and even humans in vain attempts to placate capricious and cruel gods. Today they demand a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nIn a 2007 article for The Sunday Telegraph, Pell wrote that while climate had changed, he was '\"certainly sceptical about extravagant claims of impending man-made climatic catastrophes, because the evidence is insufficient\".[35]\nResponding to the Anglican bishop and environmentalist George Browning, who told the Anglican Church of Australia's general synod that Pell was out of touch with the Catholic Church as well as with the general community,[36] Pell stated:[37]\n\nRadical environmentalists are more than up to the task of moralising their own agenda and imposing it on people through fear. They don't need church leaders to help them with this, although it is a very effective way of further muting Christian witness. Church leaders in particular should be allergic to nonsense..... I am certainly sceptical about extravagant claims of impending man-made climatic catastrophes. Uncertainties on climate change abound ... my task as a Christian leader is to engage with reality, to contribute to debate on important issues, to open people's minds, and to point out when the emperor is wearing few or no clothes.\n\n[edit] Interfaith issues\n[edit] Islam\nPell has written of a need to \"deepen friendship and understanding\" with Muslims in the post\u201311 September environment and has said that though there is a continuing struggle throughout the Muslim world between moderates and men of violence, he believes that, in Australia, \"the moderates are in control\".[38]\nIn 2004, speaking to the Acton Institute on the problems of \"secular democracy\", Pell drew a parallel between Islam and Communism: \"Islam may provide in the 21st century, the attraction that communism provided in the 20th, both for those that are alienated and embittered on the one hand and for those who seek order or justice on the other.\"[39]\nIn 2006, at the Legatus Summit in Naples, Florida, Pell stated:[34]\n\nConsidered strictly on its own terms, Islam is not a tolerant religion and its capacity for far-reaching renovation is severely limited.\n\nHowever, he added that the human factor of many Muslims being uncomfortable with the violence and harsh intolerance of traditional Islamic practices provides hope for positive change as has occurred in more moderate Muslim nations. He continued by:[34]\n\n....denouncing the blithe encouragement of large scale Islamic migration into Western nations [as] one example of the secular incomprehension of religion [and claimed that Islam has had a] detrimental impact on economic and cultural development at certain times and in certain places...\n\n[edit] Judaism\nPell has participated in many interfaith dialogues and celebrations involving Jewish people. In 2001, he told one such audience at Mandelbaum House that he had come from a strongly pro-Jewish family and of being saddened during his studies of history to find Christian ill-treatment of Jews. Pell spoke of the need to remember the Holocaust and of his visits to Concentration camps and of his support for the right of the state of Israel to exist. He praised the role of Vatican II and of Pope John Paul II in advancing the cause of Christian-Jewish dialogue and co-operation. Pell also spoke in praise of the Jewish psalms as \"a body of prayerful literature\" unequalled in any other tradition and singled out the Jewish prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel as authors for whom he has a deep love and Elijah as one whom he views as highly significant. Pell called on Christian and Jewish leaders alike to speak together and respectfully listen to each other, saying of the Christian-Jewish relationship:[40]\n\nDuring the last 30 or 40 years there has been a significant reduction in the amount of Christian anti-Semitism. We thank God for that. To adapt to our circumstances the word of Martin Luther King \"we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly\". Our fortunes, as brothers, are inextricably linked.\n\nDuring a televised 2012 debate with Richard Dawkins, Pell stated that he had \"a great admiration for the Jews\" and repeatedly condemned Adolf Hitler. During the course of the debate, ABC moderator Tony Jones sought to imply anti-Semitism in Pell's remarks regarding the relative intellectual development of ancient Jewish society with that of great powers like Egypt, as well as in Pell's comment that Germany was punished for its role in the Second World War.[41]\nIn responding to a series of questions by Jones as to why God would \"randomly decide to provide proof of his existence to a small group of Jews 2,000 years ago\", Pell said that, while the intellectual life of the ancient Jews was not the equal of the surrounding great powers like Egypt, Persia and Chaldea, \"Jesus came not as a philosopher to the elite. He came to the poor and the battlers\". Jones cross examined Pell over his use of the word \"intellectual\" and Pell said (in reference to Biblical times) that \"the little Jewish people, they were originally shepherds. They were stuck. They\u2019re still stuck between these great powers.\"[15]\nReferring to events like \"The Holocaust, to genocide, to famine\", Jones asked why an omnipotent God would permit such events to occur. In response, Pell and Jones had the following exchange:[15]\n\n\nPell: That\u2019s a mighty question. He helped probably through secondary causes for the Jews to escape and continue. It is interesting through these secondary causes probably no people in history have been punished the way the Germans were. It is a terrible mystery.\nModerator: There would be a very strong argument saying that the Jews of Europe suffered worse than the Germans.\nPell: Yes, that might be right. Certainly the suffering in both I mean the Jews there was no reason why they should suffer.\n\n\nPell's remarks were widely misreported and misinterpreted, leading to a clarification from his office \u2013 reported by The Times of Israel as an apology.[42] Pell said that \"... my commitment to friendship with the Jewish community, and my esteem for the Jewish faith is a matter of public record, and the last thing I would want to do is give offense to either\" and that the Holocaust was \"a crime unique in history for the death and suffering it caused and its diabolical attempt to wipe out an entire people.\"[42][43]\n[edit] Sexuality, marriage and bioethics\nPell has received much attention for his attitudes to sexuality issues, particularly homosexuality. He has said that \"Christian teaching on sexuality is only one part of the Ten Commandments, of the virtues and vices, but it is essential for human wellbeing and especially for the proper flourishing of marriages and families, for the continuity of the human race.\"[44] Upon becoming Archbishop of Sydney, he stated \"Any genuine religion has two important moral tasks; firstly, to present norms and ideals, goals for our striving; and secondly, to offer aids for our weakness, forgiveness and healing for every wrong doer and sinner who repents and seeks forgiveness.\"[44]\n[edit] Divorce\nPell says that, outside exceptional circumstances such as relationships involving physical abuse, it is better for individuals and for society if couples do not divorce, particularly where children are involved.[45]\nIn 2001, ABC radio's The World Today reported that Pell wanted a return to a divorce system based on the fault of one spouse. Pell told the program that, in an effort to \"focus attention on the damage, personal and financial, that unfortunately often follows from divorce\" he had prepared a list for public consideration of possible penalties to discourage divorce (particularly where fault by one party was involved); as well as benefits to support couples who stayed together. Other interviewees rejected these proposals: the Law Council's Garry Watts, said that benefits to children would not come and that Pell proposed to \"imprison\" unhappy parents in dysfunctional marriages. Canon Ray Cleary, director of Anglicare in Victoria, said a punitive response to divorce would be \"out of touch with the realities of the modern world\".[46]\n[edit] HIV / AIDS\nMain article: Religion and AIDS\nIn 2009, Pell supported the comments made by Pope Benedict XVI in Africa in relation to controlling the spread of AIDS, in which the Pope reiterated the Catholic teaching that the solution to the AIDS epidemic lay not in the distribution of condoms, but in the practice of sexual abstinence and monogamy within marriage. The Pope said that AIDS could not be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which \"can even increase the problem\". In response to global coverage of these remarks, Pell said that AIDS was \"great spiritual and health crisis\" and a huge challenge, but that \"Condoms are encouraging promiscuity. They are encouraging irresponsibility.\"[47] Pell told the media.[47]\n\nThe idea that you can solve a great spiritual and health crisis like AIDS with a few mechanical contraptions like condoms is ridiculous. If you look at the Philippines you'll see the incidence of AIDS is much lower than it is in Thailand, which is awash with condoms. There are condoms everywhere and the rate of infection is enormous.\n\nThe president of the AIDS Council of NSW, Marc Orr, said Pell's comments were \"irresponsible\" and \"contradicted all evidence\" that condoms reduced the transmission of HIV:[48] Mike Toole (Burnet Institute) and Rob Moodie (Nossal Institute for Global Health) wrote in The Age that Pell had said a health worker from an African country told him that \"people in remote areas are too poor to afford condoms and the ones that are available are often of very poor quality and weren't used effectively\". Both professors argue that \"this is not an argument against promoting condoms \u2013 it is an argument that we need to ensure that good quality condoms are affordable for everyone and are widely distributed with information about how to use them effectively\" and concluded \"the sexual abstinence message is clearly not working.\"[49]\nIn 2010, in Light of the World: The Pope, the Church and the Signs of the Times, a book-length interview by German journalist Peter Seewald, Pope Benedict said that while the church did not consider condoms as a \"real or moral solution\", there were times where the \"intention of reducing the risk of infection\" made condom use \"a first step\" towards a better way. Pell released a statement saying this did not signal a major new shift in Vatican thinking.[50]\nAs Archbishop of Sydney, Pell has strongly supported the work of Catholic health organisations such as St Vincent's Hospital and the Tree of Hope Centre in caring for those living with HIV/AIDS.[51]\n[edit] Stem cell debate controversy\nPell supports research on the therapeutic potential of adult stem cells but opposes embryonic stem cell research on the basis that the church cannot support anything which involves \"the destruction of human life at any stage after conception\". Under Pell, the Sydney archdiocese has provided funding for adult stem cell research but has actively opposed moves by New South Wales Parliament to liberalise laws pertaining to use of embryonic stem cells.[13][52]\nIn remarks made at a media conference, in June 2007 on a conscience vote overturning the state ban on therapeutic cloning, Pell said that \"Catholic politicians who vote for this legislation must realise that their voting has consequences for their place in the life of the Church\". Some members[who?] of parliament condemned Pell's comments, calling them hypocritical and drawing comparisons with comments made earlier in the year by Sheik Hilali.[53][54] Australian Greens MLC Lee Rhiannon referred Pell's remarks to the New South Wales parliamentary privileges committee for allegedly being in \"contempt of parliament\". Pell described this move as a \"clumsy attempt to curb religious freedom and freedom of speech\".[55] In September the Committee tabled a report clearing him of this charge and recommending that no further action be taken.[56]\n[edit] Health\nIn February 2010 it was reported that Pell \"had a heart turn in Rome recently and that he's in hospital there or has been in hospital there\". It is thought that Pell was taken to hospital when he first arrived in Rome after he collapsed due to ill health and exhaustion. He was released from hospital the same day and sources close to Pell said that he has been in good health since.[57]\n[edit] Eulogy reforms\nIn February 2007 Pell instituted new guidelines when it comes for family members to speak at funerals. He said that, \"on not a few occasions, inappropriate remarks glossing over the deceased's proclivities (drinking prowess, romantic conquests etc) or about the Church (attacking its moral teachings) have been made at funeral Masses.\"[58] Pell's guidelines make it clear that the eulogy must never replace the officiating priest's homily, which should focus on God's compassion and the resurrection of Jesus.\n[edit] Other roles\nThe Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney takes the role of Visitor[citation needed] of St John's College, a residential college within the University of Sydney. This is a largely ceremonial role but he can also be called upon to give guidance and resolve internal disputes. Under the direction of the archbishop the college associates itself with the interests of the church and its mission, particularly by the fostering of appropriate academic directions in education, charity, social justice, ethics and the environment.\nPell accepted the invitation to be patron of the Oxford University Newman Society and to deliver their inaugural St Thomas More Lecture on 6 March 2009.[citation needed]\nPell is a regular contributor of articles for the Australian media, including regular columns for Sydney's The Sunday Telegraph newspaper.\n[edit] Accusation of sexual abuse\nIn June 2002, Pell was accused of having sexually abused a 12-year-old boy at a Roman Catholic youth camp in 1961 whilst a seminarian. Pell vigorously denied all the accusations and stood aside as soon as the allegations were made public,[59] but he did not resign as archbishop. The complainant agreed to pursue his allegations through the church's own process for dealing with allegations of sexual misconduct, the National Committee for Professional Standards (NCPS). The subsequent inquiry found that the accusations had not been established.[60] Justice Southwell concluded:[61]\n\n[B]earing in mind the... very long delay, some valid criticism of the complainant's credibility, the lack of corroborative evidence and the sworn denial of the respondent, I find I am not 'satisfied that the complaint has been established'.\n\n[edit] Writings and media\nPell has written widely in religious and secular magazines, learned journals and newspapers in Australia and overseas and regularly speaks on television and radio. In September 1996 Oxford University Press published his Issues of Faith and Morals, written for senior secondary classes and parish groups. His other publications include The Sisters of St Joseph in Swan Hill 1922\u201372 (1972), Catholicism in Australia (1988), Rerum Novarum \u2013 One Hundred Years Later (1992), Catholicism and the Architecture of Freedom (1999) and Be Not Afraid, a collection of homilies and reflections published in 2004. A biography of Pell was published by Queensland journalist Tess Livingstone in 2002.\n[edit] Published works\n\nPell, George (1977) (pamphlet).

He was ordained on 17 December 1977, by Bishop Robert de Provench\u00e8res of Cr\u00e9teil.\n[edit] Pastoral work\nBarbarin was involved in pastoral work until 1994, when he taught theology in the Archdiocese of Fianarantsoa, Madagascar.\n[edit] Bishop and Archbishop\nOn 1 October 1998, he was appointed Bishop of Moulins, and received his episcopal consecration on the following 22 November from the Jesuit Archbishop Philibert Randriambololona of Fianarantsoa (with Bishops Andr\u00e9 Qu\u00e9len and Daniel Labille serving as co-consecrators).

This is the second diocese in France (after that of Toulon) which will offer both forms of the Roman rite. The Tridentine mass will be celebrated every day (in conjunction with the community of Saint-Georges Church (Eglise Sainte-Georges)).[2] Saint-Georges Church had originally been abandoned in the 1970s but was renovated in 1989 by the diocese who allowed priests from the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter to conduct mass in the extraordinary form. The program will be administered by auxiliary bishop Jean-Pierre Batut.[3]\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nLouis-Marie Cardinal Bill\u00e9\nArchbishop of Lyon\n16 July 2002\u2013incumbent\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ 30 Days in the Church and the World magazine: \"Interview with Cardinal Philippe Barbarin: The lights of Lyon\" January \u2013 February 2009\n^ New Liturgical Movement: \"Cardinal Barbarin Establishes Seminary for Both Forms of the Roman Rite\" 25 November 2009\n^ Archdiocese of Lyon: \"La Maison Sainte-Blandine, un an apr\u00e8s\"\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nVatican bio\nPhilippe Barbarin bio\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nBarbarin, Philippe\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n17 October 1950\n\n\nPlace of birth\nRabat, Morocco\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6242/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 27047/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 26800/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 9005/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1701324-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130227231441 ", "Name": "Philippe Barbarin"}, {"url": "/wiki/P%C3%A9ter_Erd%C5%91", "FullText": "You may be looking for the mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s\n\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0\nP\u00e9ter Erd\u0151\n\n\nCardinal-Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest\n\n\n\nCardinal Erd\u0151 at the St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest\n\n\nProvince\nEsztergom-Budapest\n\n\nSee\nEsztergom-Budapest\n\n\nAppointed\n7 December 2002\n\n\nEnthroned\n11 January 2003\n\n\nPredecessor\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Paskai, O.F.M.\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of S.

He studied at the seminaries of Esztergom and Budapest, and the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome (where he attained a doctorate in both theology and canon law). On 18 June 1975, Erd\u0151 was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop L\u00e1szl\u00f3 L\u00e9kai, and was incardinated in the Archdiocese of Esztergom.[1] He worked as vicar in Dorog, and then continued his studies in Rome from 1977 to 1980. For the next eight years, he taught as a professor of theology and canon law at the Seminary of Esztergom, and held guest lectures at several foreign universities. Erd\u0151 served in the Hungarian Episcopal Conference as Secretary of the Commission of Canon Law in 1986, and later as its President in 1999. In 1988 he began teaching theology at the P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter Catholic University, serving as rector from 1998 to 2003. From 2005 he is the Great Chancellor of the university.\nOn 5 November 1999, he was appointed an auxiliary bishop of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and titular bishop of Puppi.[1] He received his episcopal consecration on 6 January 2000, from Pope John Paul II himself, with Archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Marcello Zago, OMI, acting as co-consecrators. Erd\u0151 was named Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest on 7 December 2002, and as such, he received the title of Primate of Hungary.[1] Cardinal Erd\u0151 became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2007.[2] In 2011 he was appointed as \"doctor honoris causa\" by the University of Navarra (Spain).\n[edit] Cardinal\nHe was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Balbina by John Paul II in the consistory of 21 October 2003. He was the youngest cardinal member of the Sacred College until the creation of Reinhard Marx in 2010.\nErd\u0151 was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI, and can continue to exercise his right to vote in any future conclave until his 80th birthday on 25 June 2032.[3]\nThe Cardinal was elected President of the Hungarian Episcopal Conference in September 2005 for a five-year term, and President of the Council of Episcopal Conferences of Europe in October 2006 for the same period of time.

On 19 October 2011, the apostolic nunciature in Per\u00fa announced that he was going to be apostolic visitor to intervene in the dispute between the Pontifical Catholic University of Per\u00fa and the archdiocese of Lima. This was a controversial choice since the Archbishop of Lima is a member of the same Opus Dei personal prelature that, through the Opus Dei's University of Navarra, granted Cardinal Erd\u0151 an \"doctor honoris causa\" degree in that same year.\nOn Tuesday, 18 September 2012, Cardinal Erd\u0151 was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI to be one of the Synod Fathers for the upcoming October 2012 Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization.[6]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Cardinal Mindszenty\nIn 2006, he sent a letter of gratitude to President George W.

His father, Pierre, was a farmer who was self-taught, and later director-general of the area's school board. Young Ouellet attended mass at Eglise Saint-Luc (now a community centre) regularly with his family. In retrospect, Ouellet has described his family as religious but not very devout. His childhood interests included reading, ice hockey, hunting partridge, and fishing. One of his summer jobs was fighting forest fires. While recovering from a hockey injury at age 17, he read Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux and started a more focused search for meaning. Pierre was reluctant about the idea of his son entering the priesthood, but it was while still a teenager that Marc told him he had made a firm decision. He was ordained in 1968 at Eglise Saint-Luc. He became vicar at the Saint-Sauveur church in nearby Val-d'Or. In 1970 he left for South America to teach in a seminary.[1]\n[edit] Professor and theologian\nOuellet spent most of his priestly career as a professor and a rector in seminaries. He also received a license in philosophy from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) (1976), and a doctorate in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University (1982).\n[edit] Bishop\nOuellet was named titular archbishop of Agropoli and secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity on 3 March 2001. Pope John Paul II consecrated him as an archbishop, with Cardinals Angelo Sodano and Giovanni Battista Re as co-consecrators, on 19 March of the same year in St. Peter's Basilica.\n[edit] Archbishop\nOn 15 November 2002 he became archbishop of Quebec and Primate of Canada. Installed on 26 January 2003), he has been one of the most staunch defenders of the Catholic faith in the Canadian hierarchy.\nOuellet is fluent in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and German. He is known for his missionary work in South America.[2]\n[edit] Cardinal\n\n\nStyles of\nMarc Ouellet\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nQuebec\n\n\nHe was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Traspontina by John Paul II in the consistory of 21 October 2003.\nHe was a cardinal elector in the 2005 papal conclave, and numerous observers believed that Ouellet was papabile himself. A report said that Ouellet had supported Cardinal Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Ouellet remains eligible to vote future papal conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on 8 June 2024. He is voting in the 2013 conclave to elect Benedict XVI's successor.\nThe 2008 International Eucharistic Congress took place in Qu\u00e9bec City, coinciding with the 400th anniversary of the foundation of Quebec City. Cardinal Ouellet was elected the recorder, or relator-general, of the 12th Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Rome in early October 2008.\nIn June 2011 Cardinal Ouellet addressed speculation about his odds in a potential conclave, saying that, for him, being Pope \"would be a nightmare\". Ouellet said that while \"you can't keep the world from dreaming things up,\" seeing Pope Benedict's workload at close range makes the prospect of the papacy \"not very enviable\". He added: \"It is a crushing responsibility. It's the kind of thing you don't campaign for.\"[3]\n[edit] Roman Curia\nHe is the present prefect of the Congregation for Bishops and president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America since his appointment by Pope Benedict XVI on 30 June 2010. He succeeded Giovanni Battista Re, who had reached the age limit.[4]\nHe is also a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Congregation for the Clergy, the Pontifical Council for Culture, the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith[5] These memberships are for five years and are renewable. Being resident in Rome, he is invited to attend not only the plenary meetings of those departments, which in principle are held every year, but also the ordinary meetings. He takes part in the (generally annual) meetings of these bodies, held in Rome. He is also a member of the Council of Cardinals for the Study of Organizational and Economic Affairs of the Holy See. On 5 January 2011 he was appointed among the first members of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.[6] On 29 January 2011, Cardinal Ouellet was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI as a member of Secretariat of State (second section)[7] On 6 April 2011, Cardinal Ouellet was named a member of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts by Pope Benedict. On 7 March 2012 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.[8]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Theology\nOuellet is associated with Communio, a journal of theology established by Catholics after the Second Vatican Council, and with Hans Urs von Balthasar, a renowned twentieth-century Swiss theologian.\n[edit] Christian roots of Europe\nIn February 2011 Cardinal Ouellet said that the relativisation of the Bible, which denies the value of the Word of God, constitutes a genuine crisis that is both external and internal to the Church. He said \"In the last decades, a profound crisis is shaking the foundations of European culture. A new raison d'etat imposes its law and tries to relegate the Christian roots of Europe to a secondary plane. It would seem that, in the name of secularism, the Bible must be relativised, to be dissolved in a religious pluralism and disappear as a normative cultural reference.\"[9]\n[edit] Interpretations of the Second Vatican Council\nOuellet believes that many Catholics interpreted the teachings of the Second Vatican Council in far too liberal a way and by doing so disconnected from the core of their faith. Relativism led to priests abandoning celibacy, a drop in proper religious education, and a general infusion of leftist politics \u2014 all of which was not the intention of the council. Ouellet stated: \u201cAfter the council, the sense of mission was replaced by the idea of dialogue. That we should dialogue with other faiths and not attempt to bring them the Gospels, to convert. Since then, relativism has been developing more broadly.\u201d[10]\n[edit] Pastoral approach\nA report by the National Catholic Reporter anticipating the 2005 papal election placed Ouellet among twenty papal possibilities. \"[P]eople who have worked with Ouellet,\" said the report, \"describe him as friendly, humble and flexible, and a man not so captive to his own intellectual system as to make him incapable of listening to others.\"[citation needed]\n[edit] Catholic education\nOuellet was sharply critical of the Ethics and religious culture course of the Quebec education ministry, saying that it relativized the role of faith within the realm of religion and culture.[11]\n[edit] Church persecutions\nOuellet has stated the Catholic Church is persecuted in contemporary secular Quebec for telling the truth.[12]\n[edit] Public apology\nIn a letter published in Quebec French-language newspapers on November 21, 2007, Cardinal Ouellet publicly apologized for what he described as past \"errors\" of the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec. Among the errors he wrote about were attitudes, prior to 1960, which promoted \"anti-Semitism, racism, indifference to First Nations and discrimination against women and homosexuals.\"[13][14][15][16]\nOuellet stated that his letter was written in response to the public reaction to the statement he submitted to the Bouchard-Taylor Commission, and that it was inspired by a similar letter issued in 2000 by Pope John Paul II.[17]\n[edit] Abortion\nIn May 2010 Ouellet stood by his comments that abortion is unjustifiable, even in the case of rape, and urged the federal government to help pregnant women keep their child. He said that \"Governments are funding clinics for abortion. I would like equity for organizations that are defending also life. If we have equity in funding those instances to help women I think we would make lots of progress in Canada.\"[citation needed]\nHaving earlier applauded Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government for its stance against funding abortions in the developing world, he added: \"If they do not want to fund abortion abroad and they do not bring at home more help to women to keep their child, I think they are incoherent.[18]\n[edit] Bishop selection methodology\nAs prefect for the Congregation of Bishops, Ouellet plays a primary role in the selection of new archbishops and bishops around the world. Bishops appointed during his term have generally been seen as theologians and defenders of the faith. Bishops appointed during his term include: Angelo Scola, Charles J. Chaput, Luis Antonio Tagle, and Charles Morerod.\nOuellet states: \u201cToday, especially in the context of our secularized societies, we need bishops who are the first evangelizers, and not mere administrators of dioceses, who are capable of proclaiming the Gospel, who are not only theologically faithful to the magisterium and the pope but are also capable of expounding and, if need be, of defending the faith publicly.\u201d He also cautioned that if a priest or a bishop aspires and maneuvers to be promoted to a prominent diocese, \u201cit is better for him to stay where he is.\u201d[19]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Peritz, Ingrid (16 February 2013). \"In Rome, bright hopes.

He studied at the Major Archiepiscopal Seminary of Naples and the Theological Faculty of Southern Italy, on the S. Tommaso d'Aquino campus, where he obtained his licentiate in theology. Vallini also attended the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome, earning his doctorate in canon and civil law with a dissertation on the new Code of Canon Law.\nHe was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Vittorio Longo on 19 July 1964. He then taught canon law at his alma mater, the Theological Faculty of Southern Italy. From 1971 to 1978 he taught ecclesiastical law at the Pontifical Lateran University, while also serving as adviser for the Italian Catholic University Federation, the movement Seguimi, and the Union of Major Religious Superiors of Italy. He later became Rector of the Major Archiepiscopal Seminary of Naples and Regional Counselor of Catholic Action. On his return to Naples in 1978 he became rector of the major seminary until 1987, when he took up the post of dean of the S. Tommaso d'Aquino campus, where he had continued to teach.\nOn 23 March 1989, Vallini was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Naples and Titular Bishop of Tortibulum by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following May 13 from Cardinal Michele Giordano, with Archbishops Luigi Diligenza and Antonio Ambrosanio serving as co-consecrators, in the Cathedral of Naples. Vallini was named Diocesan Bishop of Albano on 13 November 1999. On 27 May 2004, he was appointed Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, more commonly known as the Apostolic Signatura, resigning from the See of Albano. As prefect of the Signatura, he served as the highest judicial authority beneath the Pope in the Church.\nUpon the death of John Paul II on 2 April 2005, Vallini and all major Vatican officials, in accord with custom, automatically lost their positions during the sede vacante. He was later confirmed as Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura by Pope Benedict XVI on the following 21 April. Pope Benedict later created him Cardinal-Deacon of S. Pier Damiani ai Monti di S. Paolo in the consistory of 24 March 2006.\nVallini was appointed Vicar General of His Holiness for the Diocese of Rome on 27 June 2008, succeeding Camillo Ruini. As Vicar General, he takes care of the diocese of Rome on behalf of the pope, as well as being Archpriest of the Lateran Basilica and Grand Chancellor of the Pontifical Lateran University. In 2008 Cardinal Vallini was awarded Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.[1]\nOn 24 February 2009, he was promoted to the order of cardinal priests, with his deaconry being raised pro hac vice to title.[2]\nIn addition to his duties as Vicar General, Cardinal Vallini serves as a member of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints; Congregation for Bishops; Congregation for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life; Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. He also serves as a member of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts and the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See and Council of Cardinals for Study of Organizational and Economic Affairs of the Holy See. He will hold these memberships until his 80th birthday.\nOn Tuesday, September 18, 2012, Cardinal Vallini was named by Pope Benedict XVI to serve as one of the papally-appointed Synod Fathers of the upcoming 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization.[3]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] AIDS and contraception\nDistributing condoms in schools in the context of combating AIDS trivializes sexuality and education and must be fought by concerned parents, according to Cardinal Vallini. In an official statement, he responded to a decision by the civil authorities of the province of Rome to allow the distribution of condoms from vending machines in high schools.

He studied humanities at Colegio De La Salle Tienda Honda, and philosophy at the Interdiocesan Seminary of Caracas. From 1962 to 1965, he studied theology at St. Augustine's Seminary in Toronto.\nUrosa then attended the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, from where he obtained his doctorate in dogmatic theology, until 1971. During his time at the Gregorian, he returned to Caracas to be ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Jos\u00e9 Quintero Parra on August 15, 1967.\n[edit] Professor\nAfter concluding his Roman studies in at the Pius Latin American Pontifical College, Urosa then served as a professor and the rector of the Seminary San Jos\u00e9 in Caracas. He later served as rector of the Interdiocesan Seminary in Caracas as well. Before becoming vicar general of the Archdiocese of Caracas, he was President of the Organization of Latin American Seminaries and founded a parochial vicariate in a chabolas neighborhood of Caracas.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn July 6, 1982, Urosa was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Caracas and Titular Bishop of Vegesela in Byzacena by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 22 from Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Lebr\u00fan Moratinos, with Archbishops Domingo Roa P\u00e9rez and Miguel Salas Salas, CIM, serving as co-consecrators. Urosa was later named Archbishop of Valencia on March 16, 1990, and Archbishop of Caracas on September 19, 2005.\nHe was also elected as the second Vice-President of the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference on January 10, 2006.\n[edit] Cardinal\nPope Benedict XVI created him Cardinal-Priest of S.

Ca\u00f1izares Llovera later became a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in the Roman Curia on 10 November 1996, and was named Archbishop of Granada on 10 December of that same year. In addition to his duties in Granada, he was Apostolic Administrator of Cartagena from January to October 1998, and was elected President of the Episcopal Commission of Education and Catechesis in 1999.\nCa\u00f1izares Llovera was promoted to Archbishop of Toledo, and thus Primate of Spain, on 24 October 2002. He was elected Vice-President of the Spanish Episcopal Conference as well. Pope Benedict XVI created him Cardinal-Priest of San Pancrazio in the consistory of 24 March 2006. The Spanish primate was awarded a doctorate honoris causa from the Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera on that same date. He will be eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves until he reaches the age of eighty on 10 October 2025.\n[edit] Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments\n\n\n\n\nCoat of Arms of Cardinal Antonio Ca\u00f1izares Llovera.\n\n\nOn 9 December 2008, Pope Benedict appointed him Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.\nOn 4 March 2010, he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses.[1] He is also a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Congregation for Bishops as well as the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei. On 5 March he was appointed a members of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. He will hold these memberships until his 80th birthday.\nHe has been a member of Real Academia de la Historia de Espa\u00f1a since November 2007. Ca\u00f1izares is sometimes known by his nickname of \"Little Ratzinger,\"[2] referring to the similar beliefs and opinions between him and Benedict XVI, born Joseph Ratzinger, who himself is aware of and \"very amused by this expression.\"[3]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] On receiving the Holy Communion\nIn response to an interview in December 2008 Cardinal Ca\u00f1izares Llovera stated regarding the best way to receive the Eucharist: \"What does it mean to receive communion in the mouth? What does it mean to kneel before the Most Holy Sacrament? What does it mean to kneel during the consecration at Mass? It means adoration, it means recognizing the real presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharist; it means respect and an attitude of faith of a man who prostrates before God because he knows that everything comes from Him, and we feel speechless, dumbfounded, before the wondrousness, his goodness, and his mercy. That is why it is not the same to place the hand, and to receive communion in any fashion, than doing it in a respectful way; it is not the same to receive communion kneeling or standing up, because all these signs indicate a profound meaning.\"\nIn August 2010, the Cardinal stated that, due to the impact of earlier cultural impact and formation in children who learn at an earlier age, who are faced with mature issues earlier, and who are enormously influenced by modern morality, ethical systems, and the mass communications media, it might be preferable to start preparations for receiving the Sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist at an earlier age, which could also lead to lowering the age of reception for those sacraments (which is now about 7 or 8, the age of reason, where young children begin to be held responsible for their actions and belief systems).\n[edit] On Summorum Pontificum and Tridentine Mass\nIn regard to the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, Ca\u00f1izares Llovera has stated, \"[The] intention of the Pope has not only been to satisfy the followers of Monsignor Lefevbre, nor to confine himself to respond to the just wishes of the faithful who feel attached...to the liturgical heritage represented by the Roman Rite, but also, and in a special way, to open the liturgical richness of the Church to all the faithful, thus making possible the discovery of the treasures of the liturgical patrimony of the Church to those who still do not know it...even if there were not a single 'traditionalist' whom to satisfy, this 'discovery' would have been enough to justify the provisions of the Pope.\"\n[edit] Abortion and child abuse\nSee also: Abortion\u00a0and Child abuse\nSpeaking in the context of an abortion debate prompted by a Spanish government proposal, the Cardinal said: \u201cWhat happened in some schools cannot be compared with the millions of lives that have been destroyed by abortion. It has legally destroyed 40 million human lives.\u201d [4]\n[edit] Church design and liturgical music\nAs Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship, Ca\u00f1izares Llovera has established a \"Liturgical art and sacred music commission\" whose task will be to collaborate with the commissions in charge of evaluating new construction and renovation projects for churches of the various dioceses. The team will also be responsible for the further study of music and singing that accompany the celebration of mass. Ca\u00f1izares Llovera and Pope Benedict XVI consider this work as \u201cvery urgent.\" The new commission\u2019s regulations will give precise instructions to dioceses. The judicial powers of the Congregation for Divine Worship will have the power to act.[5]\n[edit] References\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructs such as ibid., loc. cit. and idem are discouraged by Wikipedia's style guide for footnotes, as they are easily broken.

Rut\u00edlio and Sister Ana Mar\u00eda; it is an organization which provided educational, medical and legal help to immigrants. He opened a Spanish bookstore and founded El Pregonero, the first Spanish newspaper in the D.C. area. In 1978, Cardinal William Wakefield Baum appointed him episcopal vicar for the Portuguese, Hispanic, and Haitian communities, and he became the executive director of the archdiocesan Office of Social Ministry. He was also named knight commander of the Order of Infante D. Henrique by Portugal in 1974 for his service to its people.\n[edit] Bishop\nO'Malley was appointed coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Saint Thomas on May 30, 1984 by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 2 by Bishop Edward John Harper, CSSR, with Archbishop James Hickey and Bishop Eugene Marino, SSJ, serving as co-consecrators.\nHe served as coadjutor for one year and then succeeded Bishop Harper as Bishop of Saint Thomas on October 16, 1985, upon Harper's resignation. While in the Virgin Islands, he worked with the homeless, and opened a home for people with AIDS. He was made an honorary chaplain of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in 1991.\nAs a bishop in New England, O'Malley first attempted to settle the sexual abuse scandal in Fall River diocese. In Palm Beach, he tried to overcome the abuse scandal there too. He also worked closely with the Portuguese and Hispanic population, which make up a large percentage of the Catholics in the United States.\nIn 1998 John Paul II appointed O'Malley to the Special Assembly for Oceania of the Synod of Bishops. In 2003, he became the archbishop of Boston, succeeding Cardinal Bernard Law, who had resigned as a consequence of the scandal there.\n[edit] Cardinal\n\n\n\n\nCardinal O'Malley speaks to students at St. Paul's Catholic Church, home to the Catholic community at Harvard University, April 30, 2006\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI elevated O'Malley and 14 others to the rank of Cardinal-Priest in the consistory on March 24, 2006, as announced on the Feast of the Chair of Saint Peter, February 22, 2006. O'Malley, who was assigned the titular church of Santa Maria della Vittoria, was one of two Americans to be elevated on that day (the other was William Joseph Levada, who succeeded Pope Benedict as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2005). In the following May, O'Malley was named as a member of both the Congregation for the Clergy and the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in the Roman Curia. In late September 2009, he became a member of the Presidential Council of the Pontifical Council for the Family, on the same day as an American couple and a professor of law at the University of St. Thomas in Minneapolis were named as consultors.\nOn September 19, 2006, O'Malley became the first cardinal with a personal blog, www.CardinalSeansBlog.org. As of Christmas 2006 he began offering a regular podcast as well.[2] He views the podcasts \"as yet another tool [he] can use to reach the young people in our Church who more and more are turning to the Internet for their information.\"[3]\nO'Malley will be able to participate in any future papal conclaves held as the result of a sede vacante beginning prior to his 80th birthday on June 29, 2024.\nO'Malley, as of September 2011, is the only Capuchin member of the College of Cardinals.[4]\n\n\nStyles of\nSe\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley, OFM Cap\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nBoston\n\n\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Politics\nCardinal O'Malley has said that the Democratic Party has been persistently hostile to pro-life groups, adding that the support of many Catholics for Democratic candidates \"borders on scandal.\"[5] In spite of intense pressure not to speak publicly at Senator Ted Kennedy's funeral, due to the latter's long-standing support for abortion rights, O'Malley agreed to assist at the funeral Mass and led a prayer, because, he said, \"as Archbishop of Boston, I considered it appropriate to represent the Church at this liturgy out of respect for the Senator, his family, those who attended the Mass and all those who were praying for the Senator and his family at this difficult time\". He appreciated the Senator's work for social justice, but said \"there is a tragic sense of lost opportunity in his lack of support for the unborn\".[6][7] In an interview published on the Boston Globe of November 11, 2008, he said that, unless the church formally excommunicated them, he would not deny Communion to Catholic politicians in his diocese who support abortion rights.[8]\nAt the time of his elevation into the College of Cardinals, he joked that the scarlet robes that are customary for the \"red hat\" ceremony would be useful in the case he was invited to go quail hunting with Vice President Dick Cheney.[9]\n[edit] Leadership Conference of Women Religious\nIn a letter to the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, which had been under investigation by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, O'Malley said that \"the Church is grateful for all that your communities have done and continue to do to advance the mission of the Church, especially in the areas of health care, education, social services and pastoral ministry, as are highlighted in the exhibit\".[10]\n[edit] Sexual abuse policies\nHe has settled 101 abuse claims and claims to have initiated a zero-tolerance policy against sexual abuse. He also instituted one of the first comprehensive sexual abuse policies in the Roman Catholic Church.[11]\n[edit] Pro-Life Views and Policies \u2013 Caritas Christi Healthcare Controversy\nIn 2009, the Caritas Christi healthcare network was proposed to contract out certain healthcare provisions to other providers. Controversially some of these services would have included abortion and pregnancy termination services. The contract with Celticcare, set up by the Caritas board as an outside way to avoid Catholic prohibitions on material cooperation with abortion, was seen by some pro-life groups as a disingenuous way to perform abortions and procure more government funds.[12][13] O'Malley took the proposed contract and sent it for review as to its theological implications to the National Catholic Bioethical Center, where O'Malley sits as a board member, presenting an apparent conflict of interest.[14][15] Ultimately, under pressure, the diocese withdrew[16] the Caritas contract with Celticcare and no longer pursued abortion referrals at Catholic healthcare facilities.[17][18]\n[edit] Apostolic Visitor to Dublin\nIn June 2010, after the Ryan Report and Murphy Report on the abuses by the Church in Ireland, Cardinal O'Malley was named along with others to oversee the apostolic visitation of certain dioceses and seminaries in Ireland. Cardinal O'Malley was named as the Visitor to the Archdiocese of Dublin and its suffragan sees, Ferns and Ossory and Kildare and Leighlin. He will report back to the Holy See on what steps have been taken since the reports were issued, and what else needs to happen.[19]\n[edit] External links\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to: Sean Cardinal O'Malley\n\n\n\nCardinal Se\u00e1n's blog\nBoston Archdiocese page for Archbishop Se\u00e1n O'Malley\nPhotographs of Archbishop O'Malley at March 19, 2005 Boston Men's Conference\nArchbishop Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley at Catholic-Hierarchy.

He has been Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w since 2005, and was created a cardinal in 2006.[1] He was a longtime and influential aide to Pope John Paul II (he was one of the few people mentioned in the Pope's will, where he was thanked for his almost 40 years of service to the Pontiff), a friend of Pope Benedict XVI, and an ardent supporter of John Paul's eventual beatification.[2]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life, ordination, and priesthood\n2 Bishop\n3 Adjunct Prefect of the Papal Household\n4 Death of John Paul II\n5 Archbishop of Krakow\n6 Cardinal\n7 Recipient of award from Anti-Defamation League\n8 Candidate to become the next pope in 2013\n9 The Passion of the Christ\n10 Information on cooperating clergy\n11 Influence on sainthood for Pope John Paul II\n12 Decision on internment of President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski in Wawel Cathedral\n13 DeGollado and Hans Groer involvement\n\n13.1 Books\n\n\n14 Bibliography of the Cardinal Dziwisz (in polish language)\n15 Resources\n16 References\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life, ordination, and priesthood\nDziwisz was born in the village of Raba Wy\u017cna to Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, a railroad worker, and his wife, Zofia Bielarczyk.[1] The fifth of seven children, he has four brothers and two sisters.[3] During World War II, the family hid a Jewish man in their house.[3] When the younger Stanis\u0142aw was only nine, his father died after being struck by a train while crossing the railroad tracks.[3] He attended the classical Secondary School (Liceum) in Nowy Targ, passing the exam of maturity in 1957.[4]\nDziwisz then entered the Major Seminary of Krak\u00f3w, where he completed his studies in philosophy and theology.[4] On 23 June 1963, he was ordained to the priesthood for the Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w by its auxiliary bishop, Bishop Karol Wojty\u0142a.[5] His first assignment was as a curate at a parish in Mak\u00f3w Podhala\u0144ski, where he served for two years.[6] He then continued his studies at the Faculty of Theology of Krak\u00f3w, specialising in liturgy and earning a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1967.[4] In October 1966, he was appointed by Archbishop Wojty\u0142a, who had since been elevated to Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, to serve as his personal secretary. Dziwisz would remain in this position until Wojty\u0142a's death in 2005.[7]\nIn addition to his duties as personal secretary to Archbishop Wojty\u0142a, Dziwisz served as professor of liturgy at the Superior Catechetical Institute in Krak\u00f3w, editor of the official newspaper of the archdiocesan curia, member and secretary of the Archdiocesan Liturgical Commission, and a member of the Presbyteral Council.[6] He also participated in the work of the Committee for the Holy Year (1974\u20131975) and of the Pastoral Synod of Krak\u00f3w (1972\u20131978).[4]\nDziwisz accompanied then-Cardinal Wojty\u0142a to the papal conclave of August 1978, which resulted in the election of Pope John Paul I.[3] Following the death of John Paul I only thirty-three days later, he and Wojty\u0142a returned to Rome for the next conclave, wherein Wojty\u0142a himself was elected pope and chose the name John Paul II. Dziwisz recalled in his book My Life With Karol, \"I was standing in Saint Peter's Square, near the gate of the basilica. That's where I heard Cardinal Pericle Felici announce the name of the new Pope: It was my bishop! My bishop!\"[3]\nUpon the election of Wojty\u0142a as Pope John Paul II, Dziwisz was appointed as the new Pope's principal private secretary, and in that capacity he moved to the Vatican with the new pontiff. Dziwisz served as private secretary to the Pope throughout the entirety of John Paul II twenty-seven year pontificate. During the first twenty years of his service in the Vatican, Dziwisz held only the title of principal private secretary, and remained a priest. In 1998, however, he was given the additional status of Adjunct Prefect of the Papal Household, and was raised to the episcopate.\nIn 1981, he earned a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree from the Faculty of Theology of Krak\u00f3w, with a thesis entitled: \"The Cult of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop of Krak\u00f3w, until the Council of Trent\".[3]\n[edit] Bishop\nDziwisz was appointed titular bishop of San Leone and joint head of the Prefecture of the Papal Household on 7 February 1998. He was consecrated a bishop on 19 March of that year, the principal consecrator being Pope John Paul II, and the co-consecrators Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Cardinal Sodano and the then Cardinal-Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w Franciszek Cardinal Macharski. John Paul II elevated Dziwisz to the rank of archbishop on 29 September 2003, still having the titular see of San Leone.\n[edit] Adjunct Prefect of the Papal Household\nHe was best known as a member of the Prefecture of the Papal Household and for his nearly forty years of papal service as private secretary to Pope John Paul II. John Paul and Dziwisz were said to have a father-son like relationship. Dziwisz slept in a bedroom next to that of John Paul's, was always near him during Mass, and was with him almost every waking moment. During John Paul's papacy, he became one of the most influential voices in the Vatican.\n[edit] Death of John Paul II\nAs the health of John Paul declined, some speculated that Dziwisz, as one of John Paul's most trusted aides, may have been preparing the faithful for the worst. The Rome newspaper Il Messaggero reported that he mentioned his concern to another Polish priest. According to Vatican sources he told the priest, \"Pray for the pope, because he's getting worse.\" [1]\nOn 31 March 2005, John Paul's condition became so serious Archbishop Dziwisz administered the Anointing of the Sick to him. Before the death of John Paul II, Dziwisz was reported to have helped him write a message to his staff not to grieve, that he (John Paul) was happy and that they should be too.\nWhen John Paul died on 2 April 2005, Archbishop Dziwisz was at his bedside. According to rules created by John Paul, Dziwisz packed his belongings and vacated the papal apartments before they were sealed by the Camerlengo. It was believed that John Paul had hoped to appoint Archbishop Dziwisz as Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w and elevate him to become a cardinal, a post and title the pope had held. A vacancy did not however occur before John Paul's death. It was Pope Benedict XVI who named Dziwisz to the post of archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, and later elevated him to cardinal.\nDuring the Mass of Requiem on 8 April for John Paul, Archbishop Dziwisz had the honour of placing a white silk veil over the face of the Pope before the body was lowered into three separate caskets. It was the symbolic last act of service of Archbishop Dziwisz as papal secretary for John Paul.\n[edit] Archbishop of Krakow\nOn 3 June 2005, Benedict XVI appointed Dziwisz as successor to the retiring Cardinal Macharski as Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w. It had been suggested that John Paul II had been grooming Dziwisz for the position and was merely waiting for Macharski to retire before making such an appointment. Benedict XVI is believed to have made the appointment in fulfilment of one of the last wishes of John Paul II.\n\n\nStyles of\nStanis\u0142aw Cardinal Dziwisz\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nKrak\u00f3w\n\n\n[edit] Cardinal\nAt the consistory of 24 March 2006, Archbishop Dziwisz was raised to the cardinalate, becoming Cardinal-Priest of the Titulus S. Mariae de Populo. It is customary to name the bishops of certain important episcopal sees, such as Krak\u00f3w, to the College of Cardinals. Dziwisz had also been mentioned as the possible secret cardinal in pectore appointed by John Paul II in 2003, but the pope took this secret to the grave. Dziwisz's elevation to the cardinalate will allow him to participate in any upcoming papal conclaves until his 80th birthday in 2019.\nIn May 2006, Pope Benedict named Cardinal Dziwisz to be a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education and the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.\nIn 2012, Cardinal Dziwisz, possibly as part of a broader trip, was scheduled to visit parishes with a significant Polish presence in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, in Newark, New Jersey, in the United States.\n[edit] Recipient of award from Anti-Defamation League\nOn May 26, 2010, Cardinal Dsiwisz was awarded the Cardinal Bea Interfaith Award of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League. \u201cCardinal Dziwisz is a valued friend to the Jewish people and someone I know I can trust and turn to in moments of tension or controversy,\u201d said Abraham Foxman, President of the Anti-Defamation League.\nCardinal Dsiwisz replied \u201cAs the Bishop of Krakow, I would like to assure all of you that the Catholic Church in Poland wants to follow the example of Pope John Paul II, and courageously uncover and reject everything which makes the life of the Polish Catholics depart from the Gospel,\u201d said Cardinal Dziwisz. \u201cFor this reason, we note with shame that despite the unambiguous teachings of recent Popes on the appropriate attitudes of Catholics to Jews, many among us have not been able to overcome prejudices, inveterate resentments and harmful stereotypes.\u201d\n[edit] Candidate to become the next pope in 2013\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section has multiple issues. Please help improve it or discuss these issues on the talk page. \n\n\nOn February 11, 2013, Pope Benedict XVI resigned, effective February 28, 2013, citing health concerns. While neither the youngest nor the most prominent name among the active cardinals considered in the running for the next pope[citation needed], for 40 years Dziwisz was the private secretary to Karol Wojtyla, who became Pope John Paul II. Dziwisz assumed responsibility for the pope's correspondence and the Pope's Vatican matters during the pope's ill years. Dziwisz' experience at the highest levels of the Vatican make him among the most qualified candidates for pope[citation needed] and the most well-versed in terms of Vatican protocol, procedure and upholding Vatican dogma.\nWhen Benedict XVI decided to resign as Pope during February of 2013, Cardinal Dziwisz said that the late Pope John Paul II had stayed on as Pope, despite failing health in the last decade of his life, because the late Pontiff believed 'you cannot come down from the cross'.[8] He added, \"I understand the reasons that the Holy Father presented to the members of the consistory. After John Paul II's death, Benedict XVI has guided Christ's Church with great reflection and wisdom, which come from his exceptional intellectual ability as well as his deep faith. I thank the Holy Father for all his efforts to renew the Church in the spirit of fidelity to the Teacher of Nazareth.\" [9]\nAt 73, Cardinal Dziwisz is perhaps the oldest of qualified candidates in consideration to become the next pope in 2013.[citation needed] A key difference versus the 2005 conclave is Cardinal Dsiwisz is five years younger than Joseph Ratzinger when named the new pope in April 2005. The resignation of Pope Benedict XVI allows for a conclave to elect a new pope before Easter. Nine individuals 75 years or older (older than Dziwisz) have been elected pope, beginning with Callixtus III in 1455, the latest being Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.\n[edit] The Passion of the Christ\nDziwisz himself became embroiled in controversy over his role in a papal endorsement of The Passion of the Christ.[10]\n[edit] Information on cooperating clergy\nCardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz has forbidden a priest from revealing information on clerics cooperating with Communist secret services.[11]\n[edit] Influence on sainthood for Pope John Paul II\nCardinal Dziwisz, after meeting with Pope Benedict XVI in early March 2007, dropped a bombshell in a conversation with a group of reporters in Rome. He asked whether beatification, a step that allows for 'local' devotion, was even necessary for a world figure like Pope John Paul II and inferred his influence could expedite the process for John Paul II to become a Catholic saint on a faster track than Vatican protocol normally required.\n\"It is certainly possible to skip the beatification and immediately begin the canonization process. This is something the Holy Father can decide,\" Cardinal Dziwisz said.[12]\n[edit] Decision on internment of President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski in Wawel Cathedral\nIn April 2010, Cardinal Dziwisz decided the late Polish President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski would be buried in the Wawel Cathedral. The controversial decision led to protests throughout Poland. Dziwisz later claimed that the idea came from the president's twin brother, Prime Minister Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski and not him.[13]\n[edit] DeGollado and Hans Groer involvement\nDziwisz was a staunch supporter of Roman Catholic priest Marcial Maciel Degollado of Mexico, the founder of the Legion of Christ and the Regnum Christi movement. Author Jason Berry wrote Degollado spent years cultivating Vatican support by funneling money to the Vatican. Under Degollado, the Legion of Christ steered streams of money through Dziwisz to the pope and the Vatican designated for use in relation to the pope's private Masses in the Apostolic Palace.[14]\nDziwisz was instrumental in blocking an investigation into allegations of harassment against the late Benedictine Cardinal of Vienna Hans Hermann Cardinal Groer. Groer, who died in 2003, headed the Vienna archdiocese and presided over the influential Austrian episcopal conference. Groer, who always denied wrongdoing, was praised by Pope John Paul II as a faithful servant.[15]\n[edit] Books\n\nA Life with Karol, Doubleday, 2008.

He was educated at the Episcopal Seminary of Fidenza, Fidenza and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, graduating with a doctorate in Canon law and has a diploma of specialization in moral theology.

He then returned to his Diocese of Fidenza in 1965, where he was taught moral theology in the seminaries of Fidenza and Parma; and later, at the Studio Teologico bolognese; at the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica in Milan; and at the Theological Faculty of Northern Italy, specialising in the moral doctrine of marriage and the bioethics concerning human procreation.\nHe taught medical ethics at the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery in Universit\u00e0 Cattolica's campus in Rome. He was a Member of the International Theological Commission from 1974\u20131984 he also held the position of Consultor of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. He was the President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family in 1980 and founded sections of the same institute in the United States, Spain and Mexico.\n[edit] Episcopate\nHe was elected Archbishop of Ferrara-Comacchio on 8 September 1995 being consecrated on 21 October 1995 at the cathedral of Fidenza, by Giacomo Biffi, Archbishop of Bologna, assisted by Giovanni Battista Re, Titular Archbishop of Vescovio, and by Carlo Poggi, Bishop of Fidenza. In 2003 he was transferred to the metropolitan see of Bologna.\nCaffara is a noted opponent of contraception within the Church and has argued that condom campaigns further exposed society to AIDS because the means of protection are far from reliable.[1] In 1988, the NY Times quoted Caffara as asserting in regards to the use of condoms that acting in accord with morality outweighed any potential \"physical harm\": \"Even the smallest moral wrong is so much greater than any physical wrong. I know this is hard for some to accept when the dangers are great, but the church is here to combat moral wrongs.\"[2]\n[edit] Cardinalate\nCaffarra was created cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in the consistory of 24 March 2006, becoming the Cardinal-Priest of the Titulus S. Ioannis Baptistae Florentinorum. On 6 May 2006 Pope Benedict XVI appointed him a member of the executive committee of the Pontifical Council for the Family .[3]\nIn a note that Caffarra published on 14 February 2010, he wrote that \"public officials who openly support same-sex marriage cannot consider themselves to be Catholic\". As his reason for making this judgement he said: \"It's impossible for the Catholic faith and support for putting homosexual unions on equal footing with marriage to coexist in one's conscience \u2013 the two contradict each other.\"[4]\nIn June 2013 Cardinal Caffarra will submit his age induced resignation to the Pope who will decide on a successor.\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Vatican AIDS Meeting Hears O'Connor Assail Condom Use\n^ [1]\n^ 'New Cardinals Get Curial Assignments' Zenit News Service, 7 May 2006\n^ The Boston Pilot, 17 February 2010\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nCarlo Caffarra at the Catholic Pages\nunofficial collection of Cardinal Caffarra's speeches\n\n\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nGiacomo Biffi\nArchbishop of Bologna\n16 December 2003\u2013present\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nCaffarra, Carlo\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n1 June 1938\n\n\nPlace of birth\nSamboseto di Busseto, Italy\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6283/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 27095/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 27465/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 8499/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:4173615-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130227223907 ", "Name": "Carlo Caffarra"}, {"url": "/wiki/Se%C3%A1n_Brady", "FullText": "For other people named Se\u00e1n Brady, see Se\u00e1n Brady (disambiguation).\n\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0\nSe\u00e1n Brady\n\n\nCardinal-Archbishop of Armagh\n\n\n\n\n\nSee\nArmagh\n\n\nAppointed\n13 December 1994 (Coadjutor)\n\n\nEnthroned\n3 November 1996\n\n\nPredecessor\nCahal Daly\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of Ss.

He then furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Irish College and Pontifical Lateran University, where he earned a Licentiate in Sacred Theology in 1964.[2]\n[edit] Priesthood\nBrady was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Luigi Traglia on 22 February 1964.[4] Finishing his studies at the Pontifical Lateran University, he there earned a doctorate in canon law in 1967.[2] Upon his return to Ireland that year, he served as a professor at his alma mater of St. Patrick's in Cavan until 1980. At St. Patrick's, he taught a variety of subjects including Latin, Commerce, Religion, and French, as well as training college football teams at all age levels.[5] While he was teaching at the school, in 1975, he was present when children signed vows of silence over allegations against a paedophile priest.[6] One of the victims gave him a list of other children being abused by Father Brendan Smyth, who was convicted in 1994 of dozens of offences over a 40-year period. In his capacity as a notary, he handed over signed statements from the witnesses to his Bishop. However, he did not notify the civil authorities of the existence of such evidence.[7] Commenting on the BBC programme, Cardinal Brady said that the programme makers had overstated the part he played:\n\n\"It is my view that the \u2018This World\u2019 programme has set out to deliberately exaggerate and misrepresent my role in these events\"[8]\n\nFr. Brady then returned to Rome, where he was vice-rector (1980\u20131987) and later rector (1987\u20131993) of the Pontifical Irish College.[2] In 1990, he introduced Jack Charlton and the national football team to Pope John Paul II.[5] Following his return to his native country, he became parish priest of Castletara (Ballyhaise) in 1993.[3]\n[edit] Archbishop of Armagh\n\n\nStyles of\nSe\u00e1n Brady\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nArmagh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArms of Cardinal Brady\n\n\nOn 13 December 1994, Monsignor Brady was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Armagh by John Paul II.[4] He received his episcopal consecration on 19 February 1995 from Cardinal Cahal Daly, with Archbishop Emanuele Gerada and Bishop Gerard Clifford, serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral.[4] He selected as his episcopal motto: Jesum Christum Cognoscere, meaning: \"To Know Jesus Christ\" (John 17:3).[3]\nUpon Cardinal Daly's retirement on 1 October 1996, Bishop Brady automatically became Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland[4] and was formally installed as Archbishop on the following 3 November.[4] He presided over Cardinal Daly's funeral services in January 2010.\n[edit] Cardinal\nOn 24 November 2007 Archbishop Brady was created Cardinal-Priest of Santi Quirico e Giulitta as a symbol of the new cardinal's role in helping the pontiff to minister to the diocese of Rome. Following his elevation to the cardinalate he joined Cardinals Cahal Daly and Desmond Connell as one of three living Irish cardinals, a record in Irish history. Senior Vatican figures suggested that the archbishop's positive contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process weighed heavily in Pope Benedict's decision to make him a Cardinal.\nCardinal Brady, as Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, was elected President of the Irish Episcopal Conference.\nOn 12 June 2008 in addition to his main duties he was appointed by Benedict as a member of congregations in the Roman Curia.[9] These are: the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the Pontifical Council for Culture.\nBrady has kept a somewhat lower profile than the recent Archbishops of Armagh, Cahal Daly and Tom\u00e1s \u00d3 Fiaich, both of whom developed their reputations during the difficult days of the Troubles and the Hunger Strikes.\nIn 2001, Pope John Paul II chose to make the then Archbishop of Dublin and Primate of Ireland, Desmond Connell a cardinal, even though Connell was technically number two in church ranking behind Brady. It was the first time in a century that the red hat was given to the Archbishop of Dublin rather than the Archbishop of Armagh. This was balanced in 2007, when Brady was elevated to the cardinalate. In 1984, the then Archbishop of Dublin, Dermot Ryan, was nominated a cardinal by Pope John Paul II and transferred to a position in Rome, the Pro-Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. However, Archbishop Ryan died before the consistory that would have elevated him to the cardinalate.\n[edit] Health\nIn April 2010, Cardinal Brady, who was under pressure to resign and had publicly stated he was considering his position over his role in the cover-up of the activities of a paedophile priest, was officiating at a confirmation ceremony in the parish church of Kildress in County Tyrone, when he fell ill. He remained in a conscious state while waiting for an ambulance to arrive at the church. He is known to suffer from a blood pressure condition.[10] He was admitted to Craigavon Area Hospital for observation.[10]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Same-sex unions in Ireland\nOn 4 November 2008, Brady criticised the Government's plan allowing for the recognition of cohabiting and same-sex couples, describing the plan in the negative sense as \"perhaps the greatest revolution in the history of the Irish family\" and that instead the Government were obliged by the Constitution to guard the institution of marriage \"with special care\".[11]\n[edit] Credit union-type institutions\nOn 13 August 2009, Brady suggested that, with confidence in commercial banks declining, the time may have come for economists to take the lead in developing credit union-type institutions. These would focus on systems of lending, saving and insurance built on an ethic of authentic human development, the cardinal stated at the opening of the national novena in Knock Shrine, County Mayo. He noted that \"Such initiatives would certainly increase the hope of a more humane and ethically robust economy.\" One such initiative was the credit union movement. Another was the Knights of Columbus ethical investment programme.[12]\n[edit] Irish overseas development budget\nOn 26 October 2009 Brady said that further cuts to Ireland\u2019s overseas development budget would have a devastating impact on the lives of some of the world's poorest people, In a letter to Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan he said: \"These vulnerable people have had no part to play in creating the multiple crises now facing them \u2013 climate, financial, food \u2013 yet the challenges they face are unprecedented. I appeal to you not to turn your back on them. We must ensure that we maintain our current level of aid spending until such a time as we are in a position to build it up again.\"[13]\n[edit] Education\nCardinal Brady said in January 2010, that it was \"blatantly unjust\" and \"a complete red herring\" to say that the Catholic Church has no right to be involved in schools that receive State funding, in a strong defence of the role of the church in education. He said that parents had a right to have their children educated in accordance with their philosophical and religious convictions and the State had a duty to support this with public funds. The presumption the Catholic Church wanted to control as many schools as it could, irrespective of parental demands, was increasingly seen to be unfounded, he added.[14]\n[edit] Abortion\nIn December 2010 Cardinal Brady said a European Court of Human Rights ruling did not oblige the State to introduce legislation authorising abortion. The European court ruled Ireland has failed to properly implement the constitutional right to abortion where a woman is entitled to one where her life is at risk. Cardinal Brady said the judgment \"leaves future policy in Ireland on protecting the lives of unborn children in the hands of the Irish people and does not oblige Ireland to introduce legislation authorising abortion\".[15]\n[edit] Closure of embassy\nIn November 2011 Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore announced that due to cost-cutting measures, the Irish embassy to the Holy See would close and that the duties of the ambassador would be dealt with by the secretary-general of the department. Cardinal Brady said that the closure \u201cmeans that Ireland will be without a resident Ambassador to the Holy See for the first time since diplomatic relations were established and envoys were exchanged between the two states in 1929\". He added that \u201cThis decision seems to show little regard for the important role played by the Holy See in international relations and of the historic ties between the Irish people and the Holy See over many centuries\" and went on to say that \"It is worth recalling that for the new Irish State, the opening of diplomatic relations with the Holy See in 1929 was a very significant moment. It was very important in asserting the identity and presence of the Irish Free State internationally in view of the fact that Irish diplomatic representation abroad was then confined to the legation in Washington, the office of the high commissioner in London, the permanent delegate to the League of Nations, and the Embassy to the Holy See\".[16]\n[edit] Murphy Report\nThe Cardinal told RT\u00c9 News in an interview, broadcast in December 2009 after the publication of the Murphy Report, that he was confident Bishop Donal Murray of Limerick will \u201cdo the right thing\u201d in terms of considering his position in the wake of criticism in the Dublin diocesan report.[17] He also said in that interview \u201cIf I found myself in a situation where I was aware that my failure to act had allowed or meant that other children were abused, well then, I think I would resign.\u201d\nThe unprecedented 15\u201316 February 2010 summit at the Vatican with Pope Benedict and senior members of the Curia was described by the Cardinal as \u201cone step in a process [...] which will lead to a journey of repentance, renewal and reconciliation\u201d. He said that process \u201chopefully, will gain momentum when we get back to Ireland\u201d. At 8:00\u00a0am twenty-four of Ireland\u2019s diocesan bishops met Pope Benedict and seven leading members of the Curia in the first of three sessions, which continued to 1:00\u00a0pm and resume after noon until 8:00\u00a0pm The 16 February session began at 8:00\u00a0am and ended late that morning. Each Irish bishop spoke for about five minutes.\nBrady agreed that there had been \u201ctensions\u201d among the bishops over the fallout from the Murphy Report, \u201cbut to describe them as \u2018divisions\u2019 is another matter. Last week at Knock we had a very cordial retreat. Things were thrashed out fully and frankly\u201d, he said.[18] Brady brought up popular sentiment in his country that Papal envoy to Ireland Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza should appear before the Foreign Affairs committee of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, but was told that by practice a nuncio will not appear before a parliamentary committee.[19]\n[edit] Subsequent revelations and calls for resignation\nIn March 2010 it became widely known that the then Father Se\u00e1n Brady had participated in an internal Church legal process into the actions of Father Brendan Smyth in 1975. The process required all participants to maintain the confidentiality of the tribunal. Smyth went on to abuse dozens of children before being brought to justice in 1994.[20] Taken alongside his statement in December, this led to widespread calls for Cardinal Brady's resignation.[21][22] The information of this internal process had been publicly available as far back as 10 August 1997 in an article by Declan White in the Mirror.[23]\nOne of those who was a child interviewed in the internal process is suing Cardinal Brady on the grounds that complaints about Fr. Smyth were not reported to the Garda, that steps were not taken to prevent Fr. Smyth from committing further assaults, that the children were required to sign oaths not to discuss the complaints and that the failure to report the complaints led to the plaintiff and others not receiving appropriate medical treatment.[24]\nLabour Party spokesman on social and family affairs R\u00f3is\u00edn Shortall TD, said Cardinal Brady was \u201chopelessly compromised by what has emerged\u201d. She said, \u201cThere should be a Garda investigation to determine whether or not the failure to report Fr Smyth\u2019s crimes to the civil authorities was, itself, a criminal offence.\"[25]\nOn 17 March 2010, the Deputy First Minister for Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness, called for Brady to resign.[26]\nIn May 2010, Cardinal Brady said that he will not resign as archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland.[27]\nStanding outside Armagh Cathedral, Brady acknowledged there were some who would not agree with his decision but vowed to lead the Church\u2019s efforts to improve child protection measures. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t an easy decision\u201d he said. \u201cI have listened to a lot of people, reflected as I said I would, I listened to survivors, to priests, to religious people up and down the length of this diocese and I have decided to continue in my present role, to play my part in this diocese. \u201cBecause I want to maintain the momentum towards better child safeguarding and not alone that, also the momentum towards renewal of the faith, which is essential here and a big challenge.\u201d\nDr. Brady said the vast majority of people he had spoken to wanted him to remain in post. \u201cI was on pilgrimage to Lourdes yesterday with 800 people from this diocese and not one said they had no confidence in me, they said they wanted me to stay and continue this work.\u201d Cardinal Brady told mass-goers at his St Patrick\u2019s Day homily in March that he would take a period of time to reflect on his future in the church. He confirmed he would stay on following the announcement yesterday of an all-island audit into how the Church handles abuse allegations. He said he had asked for his own diocese to be inspected by Vatican officials.[28]\nIn September 2010 Cardinal Brady asked whether Irish people have lost their capacity for mercy and forgiveness. \u201cHave we become too aggressive and impatient in relation to the weaknesses and failings of others,\u201d he asked. Speaking at a Mass in Ballaghaderreen, Co Roscommon, held to mark the 200th anniversary of St Nathy\u2019s College there, he said: \u201cI sometimes wonder if we are in danger of losing our sense of mercy and forgiveness in Ireland today.\u201d[29]\nIn May 2012 the BBC's This World show found that Sean Brady had the names and addresses of children being abused by the paedophile priest Brendan Smyth, but \"did not ensure their safety\".[30]\n[edit] Appointment of a coadjutor\nIn response to a request that the Cardinal made in 2010 for the appointment of a coadjutor, Pope Benedict XVI on 18 January 2013 named as Coadjutor Archbishop of Armagh 51-year-old Monsignor Eamon Martin of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Derry, where he had been serving as diocesan administrator. As coadjutor, he will be the Cardinal's chief deputy and destined to succeed him as Metropolitan Archbishop of Armagh on the death or retirement of the Cardinal, who is obliged to offer his resignation, at latest, on reaching 75 years of age on 16 August 2014.[31]\n[edit] See also\n\nRoman Catholicism in Ireland\nDiarmuid Martin, archbishop of Dublin and Primate of Ireland\nCatholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland\nWillie Walsh, bishop of Killaloe\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ McCartney, Jenny (5 May 2012). \"The Roman Catholic Church has protected evil for too long\".

His surname, which translates to \"twenty-three\" in English, would seem to be explained, according to Vingt-Trois, by an ancestor who, as a child or baby, was abandoned and found on the 23rd day of the month. Vingt-Trois completed his secondary studies at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV and entered the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice at Issy-les-Moulineaux in 1962. He then attended the Institut Catholique de Paris, from where he obtained his licentiate in moral theology. From 1964 to 1965, Vingt-Trois performed his military service in Germany. He was ordained to the diaconate by Bishop Daniel Pezeril in October 1968 and to the priesthood by Cardinal Fran\u00e7ois Marty on 28 June 1969.\n[edit] Pastoral work\nDuring his priestly ministry, he worked especially in parochial catechetics and the formation of the laity. From 1974 to 1981, Vingt-Trois was vicar at the Parisian parish of Sainte-Jeanne de Chantal. He then served as director of his alma mater of the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice until 1988, also teaching moral and sacramental theology there. Vingt-Trois participated in different pastoral movements, including the Centre de pr\u00e9paration au mariage and the sessions of permanent formation of the clergy. He was later named vicar general of Paris, and was charged with the diocesan formation (the cathedral school and diocesan seminary), of the means of communications (Radio Notre-Dame, Paris Notre-Dame, Centre d'Information), of the familial pastoral, of the chaplains of public education, and of catechetics.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn 25 June 1988, Vingt-Trois was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Paris and Titular Bishop of Thibilis by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 14 October from Jean-Marie Lustiger, with Bishops P\u00e9zeril and Gabriel Vanel serving as co-consecrators, in Notre-Dame Cathedral. Vingt-Trois was later named Archbishop of Tours on 21 April 1999, and Archbishop of Paris on 11 February 2005. He was installed in Paris on 5 March, and appointed Ordinary of French Catholics of the Eastern Rites as well on 14 March. On 5 November 2007, he was elected President of the French Episcopal Conference for a term of three years.\n[edit] Cardinal\nPope Benedict XVI created him Cardinal-Priest of S. Luigi dei Francesi in the consistory of 24 November 2007. Vingt-Trois will be eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves until he reaches the age of eighty on 7 November 2022.\nAs a member of the Congregation for Bishops and the Pontifical Council for the Family since 12 June 2008[1] and of the Congregation for the Clergy since 2 February 2010,.[2] he participates in the plenary meetings of those departments of the Roman Curia, held as far as possible once a year.[3] On 7 March 2012 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.[4]\nOn Tuesday 18 September 2012, Cardinal Vingt-Trois was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI to serve as one of the papally-appointed Synod Fathers for the upcoming 13 October Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization.[5]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Holy See Press Office bulletin of 12 June 2008\n^ Holy See Press Office bulletin of 2 February 2010\n^ Pastor Bonus, 11 \u00a72\n^ [1]\n^ http://www.microsofttranslator.com/BV.aspx?ref=IE8Activity&a=http%3A%2F%2Fpress.catholica.va%2Fnews_services%2Fbulletin%2Fnews%2F29673.php%3Findex%3D29673%26lang%3Den\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to: Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois\n\n\n\nCardinals of the Holy Roman Church\nCatholic-Hierarchy\nCatholic-pages\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nMichel Moutel, PSS\nArchbishop of Tours\n1999\u20132005\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nBernard-Nicolas Aubertin, OCist\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nJean-Marie Lustiger\nArchbishop of Paris\n2005\u2013present\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 32004208\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nVingt-Trois, Andre\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n7 November 1942\n\n\nPlace of birth\nParis, France\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 7227/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 39377/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 41243/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 15538/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:839087-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130225125929 ", "Name": "Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois"}, {"url": "/wiki/Angelo_Bagnasco", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Angelo Bagnasco\n\n\nCardinal-Archbishop of Genoa\n\n\n\n\n\nArchdiocese\nGenoa\n\n\nSee\nGenoa\n\n\nAppointed\n29 August 2006\n\n\nEnthroned\n24 September 2006\n\n\nPredecessor\nTarcisio Bertone, SDB\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of Gran Madre di Dio\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nOrdination\n29 June 1966\nby\u00a0Giuseppe Siri\n\n\nConsecration\n7 February 1998\nby\u00a0Dionigi Tettamanzi\n\n\nCreated Cardinal\n24 November 2007\n\n\nRank\nCardinal-Priest\n\n\nPersonal details\n\n\nBirth name\nAngelo Bagnasco\n\n\nBorn\n(1943-01-14) January 14, 1943 (age\u00a070)\nPontevico, Italy\n\n\nNationality\nItalian\n\n\nDenomination\nRoman Catholic\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\n\nBishop of Pesaro (1998\u20132000)\nArchbishop of Pesaro (2000\u20132003)\nArchbishop of the Military Ordinariate in Italy (2003\u20132006)\n\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\n\nAngelo Bagnasco (Italian pronunciation:\u00a0[\u02c8and\u0292elo ba\u0272\u02c8\u0272asko]; born 14 January 1943) is an Italian Cardinal of the Catholic Church. He currently serves as Archbishop of Genoa and President of the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI), and was elevated to the cardinalate in 2007.\nHe is considered to be conservative in his views, and a theological ally of his predecessor in the CEI, Cardinal Camillo Ruini. In August 2012, he gave a homily at the Cathedral of Genoa putting forth the Martyr and Deacon Saint Lawrence as a model of heroic witness to one's faith life for the Archdiocese.[1]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life\n2 Priesthood\n3 Early episcopal career\n4 Archbishop of Genoa\n5 Cardinalate and curial assignments\n6 Views\n\n6.1 Abortion\n6.2 Condemnation of same-sex unions\n6.3 Social teaching\n6.4 Transparency in politics\n\n\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life\nBagnasco was born to Alfredo and Rosa Bagnasco in Pontevico, where his family was evacuated during World War II. He said in an interview: \"I became an altar boy in my parish in the historic center of Genoa, in Piazza Sarzano, when I was six years old. My old parish priest was Abbot Giovanni Battista Gazzolo, first, and afterwards Monsignor Carlo Viacava while his deputy was a young curate, Don Gianni Zamiti\u2014the latter two are still alive and overjoyed that their little altar boy has become their archbishop\u2014who supervised us on afternoons in the parish club where we went to play. The desire to become a priest was born precisely when I was in elementary school, but I didn\u2019t confide it to anybody. Afterwards I went to a co-ed middle school, always with that desire in my heart\".[2]\n[edit] Priesthood\nHe attended the liceum of classics at the archdiocosean seminary of Genoa, and was ordained to the priesthood on 29 June 1966 by Cardinal Giuseppe Siri. While a priest in Genoa, he received a degree in philosophy from the University of Genoa, served as professor of metaphysics and contemporary atheism at the Theological Faculty of Northern Italy, and led the archdiocesan liturgical and catechesis offices. He was once the diocesan representative to the FUCI (the Italian Catholic Federation of University Students) and led efforts for the pastoral care of students in the region.[3]\n[edit] Early episcopal career\nBagnasco was appointed Bishop of Pesaro on 3 January 1998. He received his episcopal consecration on the following February 7 from Archbishop Dionigi Tettamanzi, with Bishops Gaetano Michetti and Giacomo Barabino serving as co-consecrators. Bagnasco became Metropolitan Archbishop of the same see on 11 March 2000.\nSince 2001, he has held several posts within the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI), including president of the administrative board of its newspaper Avvenire, and secretary for schools and universities. On 20 June 2003, he was appointed Archbishop of the Military Ordinariate of Italy. He described his appointment as \"totally unexpected\" and that he accepted it \"with surprise and some trepidation. First of all because the military world was totally unknown to me, and then because it was a matter of an extensive diocese, covering the whole country and even beyond, with our soldiers on missions to foreign countries\".[4]\n[edit] Archbishop of Genoa\n\n\nStyles of\nAngelo Bagnasco\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nGenoa\n\n\nFollowing the resignation of Tarcisio Bertone, Bagnasco was appointed Archbishop of Genoa on 29 August 2006. He was installed on the following 24 September. He defended Pope Benedict XVI in the Regensburg controversy.\nOn 7 March 2007, Benedict XVI selected Bagnasco to succeed Camillo Ruini as President of the Italian Episcopal Conference for a five-year term. \"The choice is a compromise between two of Benedict's two most influential policy-movers\u2014Bagnasco is a confirmed Ruini-ite, 'but Bertone likes him,' as one op put it.\"[5]\nOn 27 June 2007, Archbishop Bagnasco, along with several other prelates, attended a briefing at the Apostolic Palace on Pope Benedict's impending motu proprio allowing wider celebration of the Tridentine Mass.[6] Two days after this meeting, on June 29, he and forty-five others were invested with the pallium, a woolen vestment reserved for metropolitan bishops, by Benedict in St. Peter's Basilica.\n[edit] Cardinalate and curial assignments\nOn 17 October 2007 it was announced by Pope Benedict that Bagnasco along with 22 other prelates would be created cardinal in a consistory on the 24 November. He was created and proclaimed Cardinal-Priest of Gran Madre di Dio. On June 12, 2008 in addition to his duties as archbishop of Genoa he was appointed by Benedict as a member of congregations in the Roman Curia [2]. These are: the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and the Congregation for Bishops.\nAs he now holds the rank of cardinal, Bagnasco is eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on January 14, 2023.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Abortion\nCardinal Bagnasco has expressed strong opposition to abortion, especially with regards to the RU-486 pill, which has abortive effects on the conceptus.[7]\n[edit] Condemnation of same-sex unions\nIn April 2007, following a condemnation of same-sex unions\u2014in which he said, \"Why say 'no' to forms of legally recognised co-habitation which create alternatives to the family? Why say 'no' to incest? Why say 'no' to the paedophile party in Holland?\"[8]\u2014Bagnasco found himself the target of death threats from gay-rights activists. The Genoa police department, while dismissing any serious cause for concern, assigned an armed officer to guard him.[9]\nAlfonso Pecoraro Scanio from the The Italian Green Party, a vocal supporter of gay rights, said Bagnasco had made a \"grave, foolish comparison which offends millions of people\".[10] Italy's bishops have called on Catholic politicians to vote against the bill which would grant rights in areas such as health care and inheritance to unmarried couples\u2014including same-sex ones\u2014who register their relationship.\nOn June 12, 2007, the Archbishop \"received a second package containing a death threat as well as a number of bullets. \"The latest threat follows one sent previously on April 27, in which a single bullet was posted\".[11]\n[edit] Social teaching\nBagnasco affirmed that each man has the right to be employed. He also advised that the flexibility of the workforce has to be limited.\n[edit] Transparency in politics\nOn 15 February 2011, he said\u00a0: Transparency is a value which is needed at all levels for the good of the country.[12]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ http://www.zenit.org/article-35358?l=english\n^ 30 Days. \"When the Pope Calls, One Answers\" February 2007\n^ Biography \u2013 Archdiocese of Genoa, www.diocesi.genova.it.

He is the first cardinal from a diocese in the Southern United States.[1]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Priesthood\n3 Episcopal career\n\n3.1 Bishop of Sioux City\n3.2 Archbishop of Galveston-Houston\n\n\n4 Personal\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and education\nDaniel DiNardo was born in Steubenville, Ohio, to Nicholas and Jane (n\u00e9e Green) DiNardo.[2] One of four children, he has an older brother, Thomas; a twin sister, Margaret; and a younger sister, Mary Anne. The family later moved to Castle Shannon, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh.[2] As a child, DiNardo would pretend to celebrate Mass in vestments sewn by his mother and at an altar his father constructed.[3]\nHe attended St. Anne Elementary School from 1955 to 1963, and graduated from the Jesuit-run Bishop's Latin School in 1967.[4] He then entered St. Paul Seminary, where he was a classmate of David Zubik (who later became Bishop of Pittsburgh[4]) at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh.[3] In 1969, DiNardo was awarded the Basselin Scholarship for Philosophy at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., from where he later obtained a Master's degree in philosophy.[2][5] He furthered his studies in Rome, earning a licentiate in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University and studying patrology at the Augustinianum.[2]\n[edit] Priesthood\nDiNardo was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Vincent Leonard on July 16, 1977.[2] He then served as parochial vicar at St. Pius X Church in Brookline until 1980.[4][6] In 1981, he was named Assistant Chancellor of the Diocese of Pittsburgh and part-time professor at St. Paul Seminary.[5] While at St. Paul, he served as spiritual director to the seminarians.[4]\nFrom 1984 to 1990, DiNardo worked in Rome as a staff member of the Congregation for Bishops in the Roman Curia.[3] During this time, he also served as the director of Villa Stritch (1986\u20131989),[5] the house for American clergy working for the Holy See, and an adjunct professor at the Pontifical North American College.[2]\nUpon his return to the United States in 1991, he was named Assistant Secretary for Education for the Pittsburgh diocese and concurrently served as co-pastor with Paul J. Bradley of Madonna del Castello Church in Swissvale.[4] He became the founding pastor of SS. John and Paul Church in Franklin Park in 1994.[3]\n[edit] Episcopal career\n[edit] Bishop of Sioux City\nOn August 19, 1997, DiNardo was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Sioux City, Iowa, by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 7 from Bishop Lawrence Soens, with Bishops Donald Wuerl and Raymond Burke serving as co-consecrators, in the Church of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ.[2] He adopted as his episcopal motto: Ave Crux Spes Unica, taken from the Latin hymn Vexilla Regis and meaning, \"Hail, O Cross, Our Only Hope.\"[7]\nHe succeeded Soens as the sixth Bishop of Sioux City upon the latter's retirement on November 28, 1998.\n[edit] Archbishop of Galveston-Houston\n\n\nStyles of\nDaniel DiNardo\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nGalveston-Houston\n\n\nDiNardo was later named Coadjutor Bishop of Galveston-Houston, Texas, on January 16, 2004. The diocese was elevated to the rank of a metropolitan archdiocese by John Paul II on the following December 29, and he thus became Coadjutor Archbishop. When Pope Benedict XVI accepted the resignation of Joseph Fiorenza, DiNardo succeeded him as the second Archbishop of Galveston-Houston on February 28, 2006. He received the pallium, a vestment worn by metropolitan bishops, from Benedict XVI on June 29 of that year.\nAs Archbishop, he is the spiritual leader of approximately 1.3 million Catholics.[3] He once commented, \"There is a certain sense of the church in Texas...It is more laid-back, informal, which I think is good.\"[3]\nOn October 17, 2007, the Holy See announced that DiNardo and 23 other clergymen would be elevated to the College of Cardinals by Benedict XVI.[8] He was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Eusebio in the consistory of November 24, 2007 at St. Peter's Basilica. In 2008 he was awarded Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.[9] He will be eligible to participate in any future papal conclave until he reaches the age of 80 on May 23, 2029. He is the youngest of the American Cardinals, including the two that were created in November 2010.\nOn January 17, 2009, he was made a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture.[10] In March 2009, he described the choice of President Barack Obama to be the commencement speaker for the University of Notre Dame's graduation ceremony as \"very disappointing,\" given Obama's pro-choice views.[11]\nOutside of the Archdiocese, Cardinal DiNardo serves on the Board of the National Catholic Partnership for Persons with Disabilities, a position to which he brings a certain empathy, contending as he does with significant hearing loss in both ears. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of Catholic University of America, is an advisor to the National Association of Pastoral Musicians, is a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People and is part of the Ad Hoc Committee to Oversee the Use of the Catechism for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He is the current chair of the U.S. Bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities.\n[edit] Personal\nDiNardo wears hearing aids because calcium deposits in his ears have impaired his hearing. Despite his hearing difficulties, he still prefers to sing or chant parts of the Mass.[3]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Dooley, Tara (November 26, 2007), \"Unity of faith with pope among goals for archdiocese\" (\u2013 Scholar search), Houston Chronicle, http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/religion/5326401.html, retrieved 2007-12-04[dead link]\n^ a b c d e f g Miranda, Salvador, \"DINARDO, Daniel Nicholas\", The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios2007.htm#Dinardo\n^ a b c d e f g Dooley, Tara; Vara, Richard (October 21, 2007), \"Cardinal has taken to Texas\", Houston Chronicle, http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2007_4446564\n^ a b c d e Craig, Smith (2007-10-18), \"'Father Dan' appointed cardinal\", Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_533090.html\n^ a b c \"Daniel Cardinal DiNardo Curriculum Vitate\", Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, http://www.diogh.org/bishops_dinardo_bio.htm\n^ \"St. Pius X Church and School History\", The Brookline Connection, http://www.spdconline.org/history/Facts/StPius.html\n^ \"Daniel Cardinal DiNardo Coat of Arms\".

The family of his father originated from Theley (Tholey),[2] his mother also descended from German immigrants from Saarland.\nAfter attending the minor and major seminaries in Curitiba, Scherer studied at the Pontifical Catholic University of Paran\u00e1 and the Pontifical Gregorian University (from where he obtained his Doctorate of Sacred Theology in 1991) in Rome. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Armando C\u00edrio, OSI, on December 7, 1976.\n[edit] Professor and curialist\nHe served as director and professor at the diocesan seminary of Cascavel (1977\u20131978), the diocesan seminary of Toledo (1979\u20131982, 1993), and the Centro Interdiocesano de Teologia de Cascavel (1991\u20131993).\nBefore doing pastoral work in Toledo from 1985 to 1988, Scherer taught philosophy at the Ci\u00eancias Humanas Arnaldo Busatto (1980\u20131985), and theology at the Instituto Teol\u00f3gico Paulo VI (1985). He then taught at the Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Paran\u00e1 until 1994.\nFrom 1994 to 2001, he was an official of the Congregation for Bishops in the Roman Curia, while serving as a Roman pastor and chaplain during his spare time.[3]\n[edit] Bishop and Archbishop\nOn November 28, 2001, Scherer was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of S\u00e3o Paulo and Titular Bishop of Novi. He received his episcopal consecration on February 2, 2002 from Cardinal Cl\u00e1udio Hummes, OFM, with Archbishops Armando C\u00edrio and Anuar Battisti serving as co-consecrators. He was made Secretary General of the Brazilian Episcopal Conference in 2003.\n[edit] Cardinal\nPope Benedict XVI named Scherer as the seventh Archbishop of S\u00e3o Paulo on March 21, 2007. He replaced Cardinal Hummes, who was made Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy, and thus brought an end to almost four decades of Franciscan leadership of the archdiocese; before Hummes, Paulo Evaristo Arns had helmed the diocese for 28 years. The Brazilian prelate accompanied Pope Benedict for a great part of his visit to Brazil in May 2007, which was largely held in the former's see of S\u00e3o Paulo, also delivering a speech during a ceremony to celebrate the Pope's arrival.\n\n\nStyles of\nOdilo Scherer\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nS\u00e3o Paulo\n\n\nOn October 17, 2007, the Pope announced that he would make Scherer a Cardinal. Scherer was elevated to the College of Cardinals in the consistory at St. Peter's Basilica on November 24, 2007, becoming Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale.[4]\nOn June 12, 2008, in addition to his main duties he was appointed by Benedict as a member of the Congregation for the Clergy.[5] On January 5, 2011 he was appointed among the first members of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.[6]\nHe is considered by some to be papabile and is considered by many to be the top candidate to become the successor to Pope Benedict XVI.[7]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] General outlook\nScherer is considered to be theologically moderate.[8]\n[edit] Evangelization\n\n\n\n\nArms of Cardinal Scherer\n\n\nAccording to a July 23, 2010 article by the website of the Catholic news organization ZENIT, Cardinal Scherer thinks there is an \"evangelization deficit\" around the globe today, which is why Pope Benedict established a new division of the Roman Curia to deal with that issue. Cardinal Scherer was quoted in the article as saying that the Pope \"brings all to understand that this [new evangelization] is an objective of his, and that it must be the attitude of the Church worldwide, to respond to the challenges launched by the present 'change of age in the history of humanity.'\"\n[edit] Abortion\nCardinal Scherer asked Brazilians that if the country\u2019s Supreme Court legalizes abortion for babies with anencephaly, what will be the next group \u2018incompatible with life\u2019 to be eliminated?[9]\n[edit] Liberation theology\nHe once criticized liberation theology's use of \"Marxism as a tool of analysis,\" yet supported its focus on social injustice and poverty.[10]\n[edit] Secularism in Brazil\nCardinal Scherer has argued that removing crucifixes in public places would not be in the best interests of Brazilian secularism.[11]\n[edit] Priests and the liturgy\nIn reference to the popular Brazilian priest Marcelo Rossi, Scherer stated that, \"Priests aren't showmen... The Mass is not to be transformed into a show\".[12]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/11/latin-american-pope-benedict-xvi-resignation_n_2661114.html?utm_hp_ref=world\n^ Cardinal Scherer stays in contact with his relatives in Germany\n^ Whispers in the Loggia.

From 1967 to 1974, he furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Urbaniana University (where he obtained a licentiate in philosophy) and Pontifical Lateran University (licentiate in pastoral theology).\nOn 6 January 1973, Njue was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Paul VI in St. Peter's Basilica. Returning to Kenya in October 1974, he did pastoral work in Kariakomu in the southern district of Meru. He also taught philosophy at the National Seminary of Bungoma, of which he later served as rector from 1978 to 1982. In 1982, he completed a course in spirituality in the United States. He then served as a parish priest in Chuka and rector of the Philosophical Seminary of Meru.\nOn 9 June 1986, Njue was appointed Bishop of Embu by Pope John Paul II.

Despite condom use, the number of Kenyans infected with the disease continues to rise, calling it an indication that condoms are not effective as a prevention method.[3]\n\n\nStyles of\nJohn Cardinal Njue\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nNairobi\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n^ NOMINA DI MEMBRI DEL PONTIFICIO CONSIGLIO DELLE COMUNICAZIONI SOCIALI\n^ Kenyan Cardinal Blasts Government Attempt to Legalise Abortion\n^ Kenyan Bishop Blames Condoms For Epidemic\n\n[edit] External links\n\nCardinal Njue bio at catholic-pages\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nNjue, John\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nArchbishop of Nairobi\n\n\nDate of birth\n1944\n\n\nPlace of birth\nEmbu, Kenya\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 5852/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 23468/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 24879/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 8023/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 13/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:13968477-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130227034624 ", "Name": "John Njue"}, {"url": "/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Eduardo_Vela_Chiriboga", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Ra\u00fal Eduardo Vela Chiriboga\n\n\nCardinal-Archbishop Emeritus of Quito\n\n\nProvince\nQuito\n\n\nDiocese\nArchdiocese of Quito\n\n\nSee\nCathedral of Quito\n\n\nEnthroned\n21 March 2003\n\n\nReign ended\n11 Sep 2010\n\n\nPredecessor\nAntonio Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Zum\u00e1rraga\n\n\nSuccessor\nFausto Tr\u00e1vez Tr\u00e1vez\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Via\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nOrdination\n28 July 1957\nby\u00a0Leonidas Eduardo Proa\u00f1o Villalba\n\n\nConsecration\n21 May 1972\nby\u00a0Pablo Mu\u00f1oz Vega\n\n\nCreated Cardinal\n20 November 2010\n\n\nRank\nCardinal-Priest\n\n\nPersonal details\n\n\nBorn\n(1934-01-01) January 1, 1934 (age\u00a079)\nRiobamba, Ecuador\n\n\nNationality\nEcuadorian\n\n\nDenomination\nRoman Catholic\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\n\nAuxiliary Bishop of Guayaquil (1972-1975)\nTitular Bishop of Ausafa (1972-1975)\nBishop of Azogues (1975-1989)\nBishop of the Military Ordinariate of Ecuador (1989-2003)\nTitular Bishop of Pauzera (1989-1998)\n\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\n\nRa\u00fal Eduardo Vela Chiriboga (born 1 January 1934) is the Archbishop Emeritus of Quito.

He belongs to one of the royal families of Basakata; his second name, Monsengwo, means \"nephew of the traditional chief\".[1]\nHe did his initial ecclesiastical studies at the Seminary of Bokoro and furthered them at the Major Seminary of Kabwe. where he studied philosophy. He was sent to Rome to attend the Pontifical Urbaniana University, and the Pontifical Biblical Institute. He also studied at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Jerusalem, where he was awarded a doctorate in biblical studies. He is the first African to obtain such a doctorate. He studied there under Father Carlo Maria Martini, S.J., the future cardinal. He was ordained to the priesthood on 21 December 1963 in Rome. After his ordination he did pastoral work and served as a faculty member at the Theological Faculty of Kinshasa for several years. He served as secretary-general of the Congolese Episcopal Conference from 1976 to 1980.[1]\n[edit] Episcopate\nPope John Paul II appointed him Titular Bishop of Acque Nuove di Proconsulare and Auxiliary Bishop of Kisangani on 13 February 1980. He was consecrated on 4 May 1980 in Kinshasa, in the open air, by Pope John Paul II, assisted by Agnelo Rossi, Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and Albert-Joseph Malula, Archbishop of Kinshasa. He served as president of the Congolese Episcopal Conference, in 1980 and again in 1992. He was appointed Metropoliltan Archbishop of Kisangani on 1 September 1988. When dictator Mobutu Sese Seko was losing his grip on power in the mid-1990s, the country needed someone of unimpeachable integrity to engineer the transition. Archbishop Monsengwo Pasinya was appointed as president of the Sovereign National Conference in 1991, president of the High Council of the Republic in 1992 and speaker of a Transitional Parliament in 1994. He was widely seen as a champion of peace, dialogue and human rights. He has been serving as Co-President of Pax Christi International since 3 November 2007. He was transferred to the metropolitan see of Kinshasa by Pope Benedict on 6 December 2007 after the death of Cardinal Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Etsou-Nzabi-Bamungwabi in January 2007. He has continued to raise his voice in defence of human rights, justice and peace.\nOn 20 November 2010 Pope Benedict made him Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria Regina Pacis in Ostia mare.[2] He will be able to vote in a papal conclave until his 80th birthday in 2019.\nIn December 2010, Pope Benedict named him a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education, on 10 December 2011 of the Pontifical Council for Culture,[3] on 29 December 2011 of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.[4] and on 5 March 2012 of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.\nCardinal Monsengwo Pasinya spoke of the 2011 election saying \"It should be concluded that the results do not conform to truth nor justice\".[5]\nHe was chosen to preach the Lenten spiritual exercises to Pope Benedict to the Roman Curia.[6]\n[edit] Background and Views\nDuring the 1990s, he served as president of the High Council of the Republic in the transition from dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko to democracy. In 1994, Monsengwo was chosen speaker of the Republic\u2019s Transitional Parliament, in charge of drafting a constitution and forming a transitional democratic government which would prepare general elections. Monsengwo has vocally defended human rights both in Congo and the rest of Africa and views the human being through the Christian concept of mankind.[7] He has said:\n\"Peace goes hand in hand with justice, justice with right, right with truth.\nWithout justice, social peace is badly placed. Thus, the promotion of the State of Law is necessary, at any price, where the primacy of the law reigns, notably constitutional law; the States of Law where the arbitrary and subjectivity do not create the law of the jungle; States of Law where national sovereignty is recognized and respected; States of Law where to each one, its due is equitably rendered.\nWithout truth, it is difficult to ensure justice and to speak of rights. The consequence of this is that right and not right have equal freedom of the city; which makes it impossible to have an harmonious order of things or \u201ctranquillitas ordinis\u201d. \u201cIn truth there is peace\u201d (Benedict XVI).\nThis is why in seeking peaceful solutions, all notable diplomatic and political approaches aim at reestablishing truth, justice and peace.\nChrist is our peace, He made peace, He proclaimed peace, so that all Jews and pagans could be made one people. Not by leaving each other with their privileges and their rights, but in abolishing exclusion, in pulling down the wall of cultural and social separation, in destroying the hatred which He crucified upon the cross with his body. Jews and Gentiles are no longer foreigners, or strangers, but close friends, fellow-citizens of the saints, and each one has the same heritage (Eph 3:6) having belonged in the past to the one Israel. In this way, He created a new man, to reconcile them both to God and to give them access to the Father through the Spirit.\nIt is in doing away with all these barriers, exclusion, discriminatory laws in faith and society, and especially in killing hatred that one reconciles men and peace is made.\" [8]\nMonsengwo has been mentioned as a possible successor to Pope Benedict XVI.[9]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b \"Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church\". .fiu.edu. http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios2010.htm#Monsengwo.

After ordination, he studied at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome, obtaining his doctorate in theology in 1974.\n[edit] Early career\nHe was ordained a priest on December 17, 1966.[6] His first assignment was as assistant pastor at St. Rosalia parish in Pittsburgh's Greenfield neighborhood and as secretary to then-Pittsburgh bishop John Wright, who was elevated to cardinal in 1969; Wuerl was his full-time secretary in Vatican City from 1969 until Wright's death in 1979.\nBecause Cardinal Wright had to use a wheelchair due to his severe arthritis in 1978, Wuerl, as Wright's secretary, was one of three non-cardinals permitted inside the conclave, which selected Karol Wojtyla as Pope John Paul II.[7]\nWuerl was rector at St. Paul Seminary in Pittsburgh from 1981 to 1985. In 1982, he was made executive secretary to Bishop John Marshall for a papally mandated study of U.S. seminaries.\n[edit] Episcopal career\n[edit] Auxiliary Bishop of Seattle\nWuerl was appointed titular bishop of Rosemarkie and auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Seattle on December 3, 1985,[6] which was controversial, in that he was to take over much of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen's authority by being given \"complete and final decision-making power\" in several key areas.[8] He was given complete authority over liturgy, the archdiocesan tribunal, seminarians and priestly formation, laicized priests, and issues of health care and ministry to homosexuals.\nWuerl was ordained bishop on January 6, 1986,[6] at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, Italy by Pope John Paul II.\n[edit] Bishop of Pittsburgh\nWuerl was appointed as the eleventh bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh on February 12, 1988[6] and installed on March 25, 1988.[6]\nIn 1989, Wuerl merged Sacred Heart and St. Paul Cathedral high schools to establish Oakland Catholic High School (all female-only schools) in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh, using the buildings at St. Paul Cathedral High School.[9]\nWuerl launched and hosted a television program, The Teaching of Christ, in 1990 and wrote an adult catechism with the same name. He taught at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh as a distinguished service professor. Wuerl has served as a chaplain since 1999 for the Order of Malta, Federal Association, U.S.A., a division of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, commonly referred to as the Knights of Malta.[10] Wuerl has also written regular columns in Columbia, the major publication of the Knights of Columbus in the United States.[11]\nWuerl closed 73 church buildings, which included 37 churches, and reduced 331 parishes by 117 through merging while bishop of Pittsburgh; he was managing the remaining 214 parishes when he left in June 2006.[12] Wuerl's plan, The Parish Reorganization and Revitalization Project,[13] is now used as a model for other dioceses seeking parish suppression. The mansion that housed Wuerl for over two decades, as well as his four predecessors, in the Diocese of Pittsburgh was sold since the new bishop, David Zubik, decided to live at St. Paul's Seminary. The Jacobethan Revival house along Fifth Avenue, at 9,842 square feet (914.4\u00a0m2) with 39 rooms, which include 11 bedrooms, six full baths, and a half-bath, had an appraised value of $1.5 million and is one of the largest homes in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh.[14] As of March 2009, the property was listed for sale at $2.5 million; it formerly enclosed an extensive collection of antiques, Oriental rugs, and art during Wuerl's residency.[15] The property was sold to an anonymous private trust for over $2 million.[16]\n[edit] Archbishop of Washington\nWuerl was installed as Archbishop of Washington on June 22, 2006,[6] at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and received the pallium from Pope Benedict XVI on June 29, 2006.\nIn April 2008, Wuerl, as Archbishop of Washington, hosted the apostolic visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the District of Columbia, which included a visit to the White House, the celebration of Vespers at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Mass at the new Nationals Park, and an address at The Catholic University of America.\nWuerl has been chairman of the board of directors at the National Catholic Educational Association since December 12, 2005.[17][18] He is also chancellor at the Catholic University of America. In September 2010, Wuerl was appointed by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith delegate in the United States to facilitate the implementation of the Apostolic Constitution Anglicanorum Coetibus issued Pope Benedict XIV in November 2009 to provide for those Anglican faithful who desire to enter into the full communion of the Catholic Church in a corporate manner. He also heads the U.S. bishops\u2019 ad hoc committee created for such implementation. Other members of the ad hoc committee are Bishop Kevin William Vann of Fort Worth, Texas, and Bishop Robert Joseph McManus of Worcester, Massachusetts. The committee will be assisted by Father Scott Hurd.[19]\n[edit] Commitment to priestly formation\nFrom 1994 until 2003, as Bishop of Pittsburgh, Wuerl served as a member of the board of governors of the Pontifical North American College in Rome (Chairman, 1998\u20131999), representing the Pennsylvania-New Jersey Region (Region III) of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. In 2008, as Archbishop of Washington he was again elected to the college's board of governors, this time representing the Washington DC-Delaware-Maryland-Virginia-West Virginia region of the conference (Region IV).\n[edit] Elevation to College of Cardinals\nOn November 20, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI elevated Wuerl to the College of Cardinals in a public consistory held at Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, Rome. He was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Pietro in Vincoli, (Saint Peter in Chains), in Rome. In December 2010, Wuerl was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Clergy and the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.[citation needed]\nOn October 24, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI named Wuerl to be the Relator-General of the 2012 World Synod of Bishops meeting on the New Evangelization.[20]\nOn December 10, 2011, he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture for a five year renewable term.[21]\nOn April 21, 2012 Cardinal Wuerl was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\n[edit] Public positions on moral and political issues\n\n\n\n\nPresident George W. Bush and Laura Bush welcome outgoing Archbishop of Washington Theodore Edgar McCarrick, left, the incoming Archbishop of Washington, Donald W. Wuerl, far right, and papal nuncio Pietro Sambi to the White House\n\n\n[edit] Child Abuse\nAccording to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Wuerl has \"a national reputation for zero tolerance of priests who molest minors.\" [22]\nWuerl has been a strong advocate within the Catholic hierarchy for confronting sexual abuse more directly. In September 1988 when he was serving as Bishop of Pittsburgh, he accepted a dinner invitation from a family suing the diocese for sexual abuse by a priest. Although the diocese's lawyers had discouraged Wuerl from attending the dinner, Wuerl became convinced that sexual abuse was a problem in his diocese. Wuerl settled the lawsuit with the family, and the priest involved was laicized and sent to prison. Wuerl told his staff that in cases of alleged sexual abuse, the first concern should be for the victim, the second concern should be for the victim's family, and only third should clergy consider the reputation of the Church.[22]\nIn the years that followed, Wuerl investigated every priest in his diocese accused of sexual misconduct, and removed several. On one occasion, Wuerl successfully fought to laicize a priest who the Vatican initially had protected.[22]\nIn 2010, Wuerl argued that the Church has made progress in confronting abusers. He told Fox News Sunday that \"we have succeeded in guaranteeing that if a priest is accused, and there is a credible allegation, he is simply removed from the ministry. That is reported to the authorities, and we begin to try to heal whatever was damaged in that abuse.\" [23]\n[edit] Religion and Politics\nIn cases where Church doctrine clashes with government policies, Wuerl has a reputation as a theological conservative, but not an authoritarian. Wuerl supports serving pro-choice Catholic politicians communion in most cases, once saying, \"Our primary job is to teach and try to convince people. The tradition in our country has not been in the direction of refusing Communion, and I think it's served us well.\"[24]\nIn 2009, the D.C. City Council proposed and ultimately passed a same-sex marriage bill. In November 2009, Wuerl signed an ecumenical statement, known as the Manhattan Declaration, calling on evangelicals, Catholics and Orthodox not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.[25] The Catholic Church teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman and that the extension of the civil definition of marriage to same-sex couples undermines the common good of society as a whole.[26] In the debate on the D.C. same-sex marriage bill, the Archdiocese of Washington advocated for religious liberty provisions that would protect the Church's ability to provide social services (i.e. adoption) in accordance with Catholic teaching on marriage.[27] After the Washington Post characterized the archdiocese as giving an \"ultimatum\" to the city,[28] Wuerl clarified the Church's position in a letter to the Post, stating there was \"no threat or ultimatum to end services, just a simple recognition that the new requirements by the city for religious organizations to recognize same-sex marriages in their policies could restrict our ability to provide the same level of services as we do now.\"[29] In December 2009, on the day of the bill's passage, same-sex marriage advocates still claimed that Wuerl had \"refused to alter his official position\" to reduce social services in the archdiocese.[30] On the same day the archdiocese, though expressing its view that the bill did not adequately protect religious liberty, nonetheless affirmed its commitment to serving the needs of the poor and its hope for \"working in partnership with the District of Columbia consistent with the mission of the Catholic Church.\"[31] However, reflecting the requirements of the newly-enacted law upon adoption services in the District of Columbia, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Washington was forced to end its foster care and public adoption program because it could not license same-sex couples for the program.[32]\n[edit] Criticism with Regard to the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite\nSome traditionalist Catholics criticized a letter that Wuerl issued in response to Summorum Pontificum. The letter stated that \"his permission must be received prior to making any permanent commitments by a parish for the public celebration, on a regular basis, of the 1962 form of the Roman liturgy as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite.\" Wuerl argued in his letter that this restriction is in accord with Article 5 of Summorum Pontificum, which states that \"public or regularly scheduled Masses be offered under the guidance of the bishop in accordance with canon 392, avoiding discord and favoring the unity of the whole Church.\"[33]\nThe full text of Article 5, Section 1 of Summorum Pontificum is as follows. It contains both the admonition to pastors to establish an extraordinary form when there is a stable group of faithful, and the provision that the pastor act under the guidance of his bishop in the manner Wuerl attempts to establish in the letter mentioned above:\n\nArt. 5. \u00a7 1\u00a0: In parishes, where there is a stable group of faithful who adhere to the earlier liturgical tradition, the pastor should willingly accept their requests to celebrate the Mass according to the rite of the Roman Missal published in 1962, and ensure that the welfare of these faithful harmonises with the ordinary pastoral care of the parish, under the guidance of the bishop in accordance with canon 392, avoiding discord and favouring the unity of the whole Church.\n\nIn part to further clarify the interaction of Can. 392 and Article 5 of Summorum Pontificum, the Holy See issued \"Universae Ecclesiae\" on April 30, 2011. The relevant paragraphs of that document say:\n\n13. Diocesan Bishops, according to Canon Law, are to monitor liturgical matters in order to guarantee the common good and to ensure that everything is proceeding in peace and serenity in their Dioceses, always in agreement with the mens of the Holy Father clearly expressed by the Motu Proprio Summorum Pontificum. In cases of controversy or well-founded doubt about the celebration in the forma extraordinaria, the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei will adjudicate.\n\n\n14. It is the task of the Diocesan Bishop to undertake all necessary measures to ensure respect for the forma extraordinaria of the Roman Rite, according to the Motu Proprio Summorum Pontificum.''\n\nA footnote (#6) in paragraph 13 seeks to clarify what \"the mens of the Holy Father\" refers to in this case. It directs the reader to the letter to bishops which accompanies Summorum Pontificum. The part of that letter which is germane to Can. 392 is the following:\n\nIn conclusion, dear Brothers, I very much wish to stress that these new norms do not in any way lessen your own authority and responsibility, either for the liturgy or for the pastoral care of your faithful. Each Bishop, in fact, is the moderator of the liturgy in his own Diocese (cf. Sacrosanctum Concilium, 22: \u201cSacrae Liturgiae moderatio ab Ecclesiae auctoritate unice pendet quae quidem est apud Apostolicam Sedem et, ad normam iuris, apud Episcopum\u201d).\n\n\nNothing is taken away, then, from the authority of the Bishop, whose role remains that of being watchful that all is done in peace and serenity. Should some problem arise which the parish priest cannot resolve, the local Ordinary will always be able to intervene, in full harmony, however, with all that has been laid down by the new norms of the Motu Proprio.''\n\n[edit] Bibliography\n\nThe Forty Martyrs: New Saints of England and Wales, (Huntington: Our Sunday Visitor, 1971)\nFathers of the Church, (Huntington: Our Sunday Visitor, 1975)\nThe Catholic Priesthood Today, (Chicago: Franciscan Herald Press, 1976)\nThe Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults, (Huntington: Our Sunday Visitor, 1976)\nA Visit to the Vatican: For Young People, (Boston: St. Paul Editions, 1981)\nThe Gift of Faith: A Question and Answer Version of The Teaching of Christ, (Huntington: Our Sunday Visitor, 2001)\nThe Catholic Way: Faith for Living Today, (New York: Doubleday, 2001)\nThe Sacraments: A Continuing Encounter with Christ, (Our Sunday Visitor, 2010)\nThe Mass: The Glory, The Mystery, The Tradition, (New York: Doubleday, 2011)\nThe Gift of Blessed John Paul II, (Frederick, MD: The Word Among Us Press, 2011)\nSeek First the Kingdom: Challenging the Culture by Living Our Faith, (Huntington: Our Sunday Visitor, 2011)\n\n[edit] Pastoral letters as Archbishop of Washington\n\n\"Disciples of the Lord: Sharing the Vision\", August 23, 2010\n\"God's Mercy and Loving Presence\", January 3, 2010\n\"Belonging to God's Family\", January 25, 2009\n\"Catholic Education: Looking to the Future with Confidence\", September 14, 2008\n\"Reflections on God's Mercy And Our Forgiveness\", January 1, 2008\n\"God's Mercy and the Sacrament of Penance\", January 8, 2007\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b Miranda, Salvador. \"WUERL, Donald William (1940\u2013 )\".

He is the current Cardinal Archbishop of Warsaw, having previously served as Bishop of Koszalin-Ko\u0142obrzeg from 2004 to 2007. Pope Benedict XVI elevated Archbishop Nycz to the status of Cardinal in the consistory of 20 November 2010.\n[edit] Biography\nKazimierz Nycz was born in Stara Wie\u015b. Nycz was educated at the primary school in Stara Wie\u015b; Lyceum of Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie, Czechowice-Dziedzice where he graduated in 1967; he then entered the Major Seminary of Krak\u00f3w. He received the diaconate from Cardinal Karol Wojty\u0142a on 8 May 1972, and was ordained to the priesthood on 20 May 1973 by Bishop Julian Groblicki.\nIn 1976, he obtained a bachelor degree at the Faculty of Theology of Papieska Akademia Teologiczna (Pontifical Academy of Theology), of Krak\u00f3w; then, in 1977, he started his doctoral studies at the Catholic University of Lublin, where in 1981, he earned a doctorate in catechetical studies (dissertation: \"Implementation of catechetical renewal of the Second Vatican Council in the Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w\".\nFrom 1973 to 1975 he was a vicar in a parish of Saint Elisabeth in Jaworzno. On 14 May 1988, Nycz was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Krak\u00f3w and Titular Bishop of Villa Regis. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 4 June from Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, with Archbishops Jerzy Ablewicz and Stanis\u0142aw Nowak serving as co-consecrators.\nOn 26 November 1999, he was named chairman of the Committee for Catholic Education; his main interest was to seek ways to find the opportunities offered by schools for catechetical activities and to search for forms of parish catechesis. As chairman of the Commission for Education of the Conference of the Polish Episcopate, the center of his activities was adapting the Polish catechesis to the post-Vatican II catechetical documents of the Church, especially the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the General Directory for Catechesis; and to correlate the teaching of religion in the school with the requirements of the reformed schools\nHe was promoted to Bishop of Koszalin-Ko\u0142obrzeg on 9 June 2004. On 3 March 2007, Pope Benedict XVI named Nycz, who was on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land at the time, as the successor of Stanis\u0142aw Wielgus as Metropolitan Archbishop of Warsaw. Wielgus abruptly resigned on 7 January after admitting to his former collaboration with the S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa, the Communist secret police in Poland. Nycz's appointment was greatly welcomed,[1] and his installation as Archbishop of Warsaw took place during Palm Sunday on 1 April 2007, at St. John's Cathedral. In addition to his role as Archbishop, he was named Bishop to the Eastern Catholics in Poland on 9 June 2007.\nHe holds a doctorate from the University of Lublin, was vice-rector of the Major Seminary of Krak\u00f3w from 1987 to 1988, and organized the last visit of Pope John Paul II to Poland. Records of S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa show that Nycz had repeatedly refused to enter their services.[2] He was created and proclaimed Cardinal-Priest of Ss. Silvestro e Martino ai Monti on 20 November 2010.\nOn 29 December 2010 Nycz was appointed a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and the Congregation for the Clergy.[3]\n[edit] References\n\n^ Catholic News Service.

He is the Archbishop of Colombo, and thus the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Province of Colombo in Sri Lanka.\nCardinal Ranjith has previously served as auxiliary bishop of Colombo (1991\u20131995), Bishop of Ratnapura (1995\u20132001), Adjunct Secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (2001\u20132004), Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia and East Timor (2004\u20132005), and Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (2005\u20132009).\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Priestly ministry\n3 Episcopal career\n\n3.1 Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo\n3.2 First Bishop of Ratnapura\n3.3 Adjunct Secretary\n3.4 First Sri Lankan Papal Nuncio\n3.5 Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship\n3.6 Archbishop of Colombo\n3.7 Cardinal\n\n\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and education\nAs the eldest of fourteen children, Malcolm Ranjith was born in Polgahawela to Don William and Mary Winifreeda. He studied at the De La Salle College in Mutwal before entering St. Aloysius Seminary in Borella in 1965. From 1966 to 1970, he pursued studies in theology and philosophy at the National seminary in Kandy. He was thereafter sent by the then Archbishop Thomas Cooray to further his priestly studies in Rome, he graduated from the Pontifical Urbanian University with a baccalaureate in theology(B.TH).\nOn 29 June 1975, Malcolm Ranjith was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Paul VI in St. Peter's Basilica. He then pursued post graduate studies at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, from where he obtained a Licentiate in Sacred Scripture in 1978; his thesis centered on the Epistle to the Hebrews. During his time at the Biblical Institute, he studied under Carlo Martini and Albert Vanhoye (both future cardinals), he also attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he undertook scriptural research as a postgraduate student.\n[edit] Priestly ministry\nUpon his return to Sri Lanka, Malcolm Ranjith became an assistant parish priest in Pamunugama in 1978, later serving as a parish priest in Payagala and Kalutara. His pastoral work among the poor but religious people in these fishing villages led him to become involved with social justice. He also established \"Seth Sarana\", a center for poor relief in the Archdiocese of Colombo. He once said that \"love for the liturgy and love for the poor...have been the compass of my life as a priest.\"\nIn 1983, Father Malcolm Ranjith was named the National Director of Pontifical Mission Societies. He revived the Society of the Holy Childhood and, as Diocesan Co-ordinator for Human Development, he introduced bold initiatives in areas such as housing, fisheries and various self-employment projects.\n[edit] Episcopal career\n[edit] Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo\nOn 17 June 1991, Ranjith was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo and Titular Bishop of Cabarsussi. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 31 August from Archbishop Nicholas Marcus Fernando, with Bishops Thomas Savundaranayagam and Oswald Gomis serving as co-consecrators. He served as the Vicar General in charge of Parochial Apostolate and Lay Apostolate from 1991 to 1995. His peers elected him the Secretary General of the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Sri Lanka as well. As the Chairman of the Organising Committee for the Beatification of Ven. Joseph Vaz and the visit of Pope John Paul II to Sri Lanka in January 1995, certainly impressed the Church leaders.\n[edit] First Bishop of Ratnapura\nArchbishop Malcolm was also the first shepherd to be appointed by the Holy See to the newly carved Diocese of Ratnapura. Ranjith took office as Bishop of Ratnapura on 2 November 1995. His appointment was hailed as a welcome spark to kindle the fire of missionary zeal in the hearts of the clergy and laity in his diocese. It was evident from the unprecedented numbers of well wishers of all religions that thronged to welcome him. The unflagging zeal and leadership displayed by him in guiding the flock of Ratnapura perhaps paved him the way to the Holy See.\nRanjith has always promoted inter-faith dialogue in Sri Lanka as he believes it can eliminate potential causes of tensions and disagreements between the religious and ethnic groups that make up the country. He once said that \"dialogue is vital and fundamental and as Catholics we must celebrate the richness of the Word of God incarnate in our life, families and communities\".\n[edit] Adjunct Secretary\nRanjith is also the first Sri Lankan Bishop to be appointed to the Holy See's civil service. On 1 October 2001, he was named Adjunct Secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, and simultaneously appointed President of the Pontifical Mission Societies by Pope John Paul II. It is the Pope\u00b4s ministry for the coordination of the missionary efforts of the Church and involves overview and growth of the local Churches in mission countries.\nThis Ministry coordinates over 1100 Archdioceses, Dioceses, Apostolic Vicarates and Apostolic Prefectures as well as Sui Juris Missions. The Adjunct Secretary is the President as of the Pontifical Mission Societies, which are the instruments of the Pope for enhancing support through prayer and contributions for the mission of the Church.\n[edit] First Sri Lankan Papal Nuncio\nRanjith is the first Sri Lankan Bishop to be appointed a Papal Nuncio. He served in Jakarta as the Holy Father\u2019s Apostolic Ambassador to Indonesia and East Timor from 29 April 2004 until his return to Rome in December 2005. The Catholic Church in Indonesia which consists of 17,000 islands spreads to 37 Dioceses and has one of the biggest Catholic population amongst the countries in Asia next to the Philippines being dominated by almost 88 million Catholics.\nUpon his appointment as Apostolic Nuncio to Indonesia and East Timor, then-Bishop Ranjith was raised to the rank of Archbishop, holding the title of Titular Archbishop of Umbriatico from his promotion to the office of Papal Nuncio until his appointment as Metropolitan Archbishop of Colombo.\nDuring his tenure as Papal Nuncio he was instrumental in enhancing mutual relations between the Holy See and Indonesia. He won the admiration of the church hierarchy for the pivotal role he played in assisting the establishment of cordial relations between the local Churches and their Governments whilst ensuring that the rights of the local Church are respected by these governments.\n[edit] Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship\nArchbishop Ranjith was appointed Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments on 10 December 2005. He has described the liturgical reforms inspired by the Second Vatican Council as \"a mixed bag of results.\" While praising the use of vernacular languages, he also criticized the \"quasi total abandonment\" of Latin and the \"acceptance of all kinds of 'novelties' resulting from a secularizing and humanistic theological and liturgical mindset overtaking the West.\" He has also lamented the \"banalization and obscuring of the mystical and sacred aspects of the liturgy in many areas of the Church in the name of a so-called Konzilsgeist (spirit of the Council).\"\nRanjith opposes the reception of Communion in the hand and standing, once saying, \"I think it is high time to...abandon the current practice that was not called for by Sacrosanctum Concilium, nor by Fathers, but was only accepted after its illegitimate introduction in some countries.\"[1] A staunch supporter of the Tridentine Mass, Ranjith once said that bishops who opposed Summorum Pontificum were allowing themselves to be \"used as instruments of the devil,\" accusing them of \"disobedience...and even rebellion against the Pope.\"[2] He once said, \"I'm not a fan of the Lefebvrians...but what they sometimes say about the liturgy they say for good reason.\"[3]\nArchbishop Ranjith is fluent in ten languages; Italian, German, French, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Spanish, English, Sinhala and Tamil. His ability to converse and understand the problems of the Catholic Church spread throughout the world and his commitment and dedication in the execution of the enormous responsibilities of the Universal Church on his shoulders has made him one of the most influential voices in the Vatican.\n[edit] Archbishop of Colombo\nOn 16 June 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as Metropolitan Archbishop of Colombo. naming Joseph Di Noia as Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. [6] In a letter to Archbishop Ranjith, Pope Benedict said that \"'I wish to express my sincere thanks for the fidelity, the commitment and competence with which you exercised that [Divine Worship secretary] office'\" [7] Pope Benedict also expressed that \"we have reason to be encouraged by the good you will be able to perform among the peoples of your land.\"\nArchbishop Ranjith was among 34 other metropolitan archbishops [8] to receive his pallium from Pope Benedict on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on 29 June 2009. The Archbishop was greeted with warmth and solemnity upon his arrival in Sri Lanka on 31 July 2009. Upon his arrival he was received by the President of Sri Lanka, such high-profile reception being due to the status of the Archbishops of Colombo as leaders, de facto Primates, of the Catholic community in the country. Archbishop Ranjith took formal canonical possession of the Metropolitan See of Colombo in a private ceremony on 5 August 2009 and celebrated the Mass for the solemn beginning of his pastoral ministry as Archbishop of Colombo on 8 August 2009, when he was publicly installed in the cathedra of the Archbishops of Colombo.\nOn 7 October 2009 Archbishop Ranjith issued new liturgical guidelines in his diocese. These include; \"all faithful, including the religious, to receive Holy Communion reverently kneeling and on the tongue\" as well as laymen being forbidden from preaching.[4] In addition to this, priests are forbidden to bring elements or styles of worship from other religions into the liturgy.\nIn April 2010 Archbishop Ranjith was elected and took office as President of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Sri Lanka.\n\n\nStyles of\nAlbert Malcolm Ranjith\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nColombo\n\n\n[edit] Cardinal\nOn 20 October 2010 Pope Benedict XVI announced a Consistory for the creation of new Cardinals to be held on 20 November 2010, and made public the names of 24 Prelates he intended to raise to the Cardinalate on that occasion, Archbishop Ranjith being among those chosen for promotion to the Sacred College.[5] Accordingly, Archbishop Ranjith was created a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church on the Consistory of 20 November 2010, and was assigned the title of Cardinal-Priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina.

He obtained a doctorate in theology, from the University of Bochum,[1] in 1989.\nOn 23 July 1996, he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Paderborn and Titular Bishop of Petina by Pope John Paul II. Marx was ordained as bishop on the following 21 September (his forty-third birthday) by Archbishop Degenhardt, with Bishops Hans Drewes and Paul Consbruch serving as co-consecrators.\nOn 20 December 2001 he was named Bishop of Trier (the oldest diocese in Germany), succeeding Hermann Josef Spital nearly a year after the latter's retirement. Marx is considered to be rather conservative in matters of Church discipline, but also a \"social scientist ... and whiz with the media\".[2] Moreover, in 2003, he suspended a theologian for extending to Protestants an invitation to the Eucharist.[3]\n\n\nStyles of\nReinhard Cardinal Marx\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nMunich and Freising\n\n\nOn 30 November 2007 Pope Benedict XVI appointed Reinhard Marx as Metropolitan Archbishop of Munich and Freising, a position that Benedict himself held from 1977 to 1981, . Rumours surrounding this were circulated before Pope Benedict's formal announcement, but Marx responded to these by saying, \"The Pope names bishops, not the press\".[3] On 2 February 2008, Marx was installed as Archbishop of Munich and Freising in the Munich Frauenkirche. He became Cardinal-Priest of San Corbiniano on 20 November 2010.[4] Cardinal Marx's title is that of Saint Corbinian who was the first bishop of Freising and of whom Cardinal Marx is the successor.\nCardinal Marx currently serves as head of the committee for social issues at the German Bishops' Conference. In addition to his duties as archbishop of Munich on 11 December 2010, Cardinal Marx was named by Pope Benedict as a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education for a five year renewable term.[5] On 29 December 2010 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. On 7 March 2012 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.[6]\nOn 22 March 2012, the Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Community elected Reinhard Cardinal Marx its President.\n[edit] Books by Reinhard Marx\nCardinal Marx launched in October 2008 a book (\"Das Kapital: A Plea for Man\"), named after the work by Karl Marx, that critiques capitalism.

Jose Alencherry and Fr. Francis Alencherry, SDB) and one, a religious sister Sr.Cherupushpam, S.A.B.S.). Geevarghese is his baptismal name. Mar George Alencherry had his primary schooling at St Mary's School, Thuruthy and secondary education at St Berchman\u2019s High School, Changanacherry. He began his priestly formation in 1961 at the archdiocesan minor seminary at Parel, Changanacherry. While he pursued his studies in the minor seminary, he obtained his BA in economics with second rank from St Berchman's College. After the minor seminary studies he was sent to St Joseph\u2019s Pontifical Seminary, Aluva where he completed his philosophical and theological studies.\nOn 18 December 1972 Cardinal Antony Padiyara, the then archbishop of Chanagancherry, ordained him priest at St Mary\u2019s Church, Thuruthy, for the archdiocese of Changanacherry. Later he continued his higher studies at the Pontifical Institute of Theology and Philosophy from where he obtained his master\u2019s degree in first rank. While Mar George Alencherry was pursuing higher studies at Aluva he served also as vicar of the filial church at Periyarmugham in the archdiocese of Ernakulam\u2010Angamaly. After completion of studies at Aluva Mar George Alencherry was appointed as assistant vicar at the Cathedral church of Changanacherry and Director of the Archdiocesan Faith Formation department. Thereafter he served three years as secretary of the Commission for Catechism of the Kerala Catholic Bishops\u2019 Council (KCBC). After his tenure in KCBC he was sent to Paris for higher studies. There he pursued his studies at Sorbonne University and the Catholic Institute from where he obtained his doctorate in biblical theology. On returning to India in 1986 Mar George Alencherry was appointed director of the pastoral Oriental Centre (POC) at Palarivattom and deputy secretary of KCBC. He served the Church in Kerala in that capacity until 1993. Simultaneously he had served also as professor at St Thomas Apostolic Seminary, Vadavathoor. He continued to teach at Vadavathoor until 1997. From 1994 to 1996 he was the protosyncellus of the metropolitan of Changanacherry.[3]\n[edit] Bishop of Thuckalay (1997\u20132011)\nThe Diocese of Thuckalay was erected by the Papel Bull \"Apud Indorum\" on 11 November 1996. It was formed by separating the territory of the Archdiocese of Changanassery that extended over to the state of Tamilnadu. The then Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Changanacherry Very Rev. Fr. George Alencherry was appointed the first bishop of the new Eparchy. The Establishment of the diocese and appointment of the first bishop were promulgated on 18 December 1996. Very Rev. Fr. George Alencherry was ordained Bishop on 2 February 1997 by Mar Joseph Powathil, Metropolitan Archbishop of Changanassery, Mar Mathew Vattackuzhy, Bishop of Kanjirappally and Lawrence Mar Aprem, Bishop of Marthandam as co-consecrants. He was installed as Bishop of the Diocese on the same day by Mar Varkey Vithayathil Major Arch bishop of the Syro-Malabar Church. The total number of the Catholic faithful in the diocese is 25000.[4]\n[edit] Election and enthronement\n\n\nStyles of\nMajor Archbishop of Ernakulam-Angamaly\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Beatitude\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Beatitude\n\n\nReligious style\nHead & Father of the Syro Malabar Catholic Church and the Gate of All India\n\n\nThe Syro\u2010Malabar Bishops' holy synod that began on 23 May 2011 at the Major Archiepiscopal Curia at Eranakulam elected Mar George Alencherry, the bishop of the Syro\u2010Malabar Diocese of Thuckalay, the third Major Archbishop of the Syro\u2010Malabar Church. The news of the election was announced in the Vatican as well as at Mount St Thomas, the Syro\u2010Malabar Major Archiepiscopal Curia at 3.30 pm on Thursday, 26 th May 2011. Mar George Alencherry has been elected as the successor of the deceased Major Archbishop Cardinal Mar Varkey Vithayathil.He is the first head of the Syro-Malabar Church to be elected by its synod. When Pope John Paul II made the Syro-Malabar Church a major archiepiscopal church in 1992, appointing Mar Antony Padiyara as its first major archbishop, he reserved the power to appoint the major archbishop and bishops. However, in 2004, the Holy See granted full administrative powers to the church, including the power to elect bishops.[3][5]\nOn 23 May, the first day of the synod, the synod elected Mar George Valiamattam, the Archbishop of Tellicherry, the president of the election synod. Then followed the procedures of election of the new Major Archbishop.Thereafter the president of the session asked Mar George Alencherry whether he accepted the election and in the following sitting the newly\u2010elected expressed his acceptance by reading it out before the synod. Immediately the request was sent to the Pope, through the Apostolic Nunciature in New Delhi, for the approval of the election of Mar George Alencherry. The papal approval was given on Wednesday, 25 May evening and it was communicated to the Administrator, Mar Bosco Puthur, on Thursday, 26 May morning. The papal approval of the election of Mar George Alencherry was announced in the synod by Mar George Valiamattam, the president of the session. Thereafter the newly elected Major Archbishop, according to the canon Law, made his oath of fidelity and communion to the Holy Synod and the Church. Thereafter all the bishops of the Syro\u2010Malabar Church expressed their respect and ecclesial communion with the new major archbishop. Major Archbishop Mar George Alencherry said his services will be for all people of India. He stressed inter-rite relations, inter-faith harmony and ecumenism.[3]\n[edit] Cardinalate\nOn 18 February 2012, Pope Benedict XVI elevated him to the cardinalate, giving him a unique red biretta with a traditional Nasrani cross and gold ring during a ceremony in Saint Peter's Basilica[6] and create him Cardinal-Priest of San Bernardo alle Terme. Earlier cardinals belonging to the Syro Malabar Church were Joseph Parecattil (28 April 1969), Antony Padiyara (28 June 1988) and Varkey Vithayathil 21 February 2001).\nHis visit to Rome for his cardinal creation coincided with the arrest of Marine officers on board the Enrica Lexie who shot and killed two Keralite fishermen on a fishing vessel.[7] Comments he made as part of an interview with Italian Press Agency Fides caused significant controversy as to the essence of his message, leading Cardinal Allencherry to issue clarifying press statements with Fides [8]\nOn 24 April 2012 Cardinal Alencherry was made a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. He will hold these memberships until his 80th birthday.[9]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Pastoral care of the Syro-Malabar Catholics outside the \"proper\" territory\n\n\n\n\nArchbishop Salvatore Pennacchio,the Apostolic Nuncio to India (Latin Rite) presenting the elected Major Archbishop, Mar George Alencherry with the papal gift\n\n\nHistorically the Prelates of St. Thomas Christians were called Archbishop of India. The titles used for them were \"Metropolitan and Gate of All India\" or \"Gate of India\". This indicates the highest rank of authority in the Indian Church and the extend of its jurisdiction. He enjoyed an All India Jurisdiction, the Ruler of the entire Holy Church of Christians of India.[10] The Vatican Codex 22, written in Cranganore in 1301 gives the titles as Metropolitan and the director of the entire holy church of Christian India\u201d.[11][12] In the year 1564 Pope Pius IV created Archdiocese of Angamali(With Jurisdiction over all India). In 1600 the Metropolitan status of the see of Angamaly (metropolitan of all India, or Gate of India)was abolished and was made suffragon to Goa, with far reaching consequences.The news of the reduction of the see of Angamaly from the Metropolitan to a suffragan caused much unrest among the St. Thomas Christians.They lost the title of \"ALL INDIA\" which belonged to the prelates of St. Thomas Christians for many centuries.Later the Metropolitan status was restored to the see of Angamaly but never the title \"All India\".[13] In 1896 Syro Malabar Catholic got their own hierarchy but instead of re-establishing the old Jurisdiction over all India,three Apostolic Vicariates were established in Trichur, Ernakulam and Changanassery.\nBy the second half of twentieth century members of the Syro-Malabar community have emigrated in big numbers to the other parts of India and to foreign countries. According to Vatican II and subsequent documents such as the Oriental and Latin Canon Laws, Catechism of the Catholic Church their pastoral needs have to be taken care by the priests of their own rite and in their own rite. For the pastoral care of the Syro-Malabar Catholics in Bombay, Punai and Kerala and in USA and Canada were established the following dioceses in 1988 Diocese of Kalyan and in 2001 Diocese of Chicago.Besides these two dioceses there are many communities of Syro-Malabarians in many parts of India and in foreign countries. Big cities of India like Delhi, Bangalore, Madras, Calcutta etc. have big numbers of Syro-Malabar Catholics.[13]\n\n\n\nThe faithful of the Syro-Malabar Church are about four million, of which 3 million and 400 thousand live in the twenty-eight dioceses in India. Of these dioceses, eighteen are in the territory of the Syro-Malabar Church itself (Kerala, part of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka). We have a territorial jurisdiction only in these eighteen dioceses. And we'd like to have a territorial jurisdiction covering the whole territory of India: this is one of our appeals to the Holy Father and for us it is an important request. We believe it is our right. Before the arrival of Western missionaries \u2013 the Portuguese arrived in the sixteenth century \u2013 the jurisdiction of us \u2018Christians of St Thomas' was extended to all of India. Then the Western missionaries, because of the influence of European monarchs, took jurisdiction of India, restricting ours to the areas where we were more concentrated.[14]\n\n\nInterview with H.B Mar George Alencherry, Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church by Roberto Rotondo and Gianni Valente\n\n.\n[edit] Christian unity and Petrine ministry\nThe Catholic Church through the Council for Christian Unity, has already begun a dialogue on the primacy. I think we should continue the dialogue and seek a common agreement with the Eastern Churches, as there was in the first four centuries of Christianity. At that time there was a common understanding of the primacy. Now the Orthodox Church argues that it is impossible to go back to theology before the Council of Chalcedon because we do not possess any documents from that era. But I think that from the documents and statements subsequent to the time of Chalcedon there would be the possibility of dialogue and agreement on the Petrine ministry. Because there is the phrase primus inter pares. We all need a Petrine ministry of unity, which is a reference for all the Churches. I hope that a halfway point is found where the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches could come together in full communion with the Church of Christ.[14]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Pope appoints 22 new cardinals\n^ CONFERMA DELL\u2019ELEZIONE DELL\u2019ARCIVESCOVO MAGGIORE DI ERNAKULAM-ANGAMALY DEI SIRO-MALABARESI\n^ a b c http://www.ernakulamarchdiocese.org/admin/cms/docs/n_high/222.pdf\n^ diocese thuckalay\n^ Bishop Alencherry is new Syro-Malabar Church head\n^ Pope Benedict XVI holds Consistory, announces canonizations\n^ Enrica Lexie Crew Arrested,\n^ Cardinal Alencherry back says he shares grief of fishermens families\n^ http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/29094.php?index=29094&po_date=21.04.2012&lang=en\n^ Rev.

(born 26 April 1943, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Bohemia (now Czech Republic) is the 36th Archbishop of Prague[1][2] and a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.[3] He previously served as Bishop of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9.\nDuka was born in 1943 in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. On 6 January 1969 he made temporary profession in the Dominican Order and on 22 June 1970 he was ordained a priest. For five years he worked in various parishes of the archdiocese of Prague and, on 7 January 1972, he made his solemn profession in the Dominican Order.\nIn 1975, the Communist government deprived him of the authorisation for the sacred ministry. For almost fifteen years \u2013 until the regime collapsed in 1989 \u2013 Duka worked as a designer at the factories of \u0160koda at Plze\u0148. In the meantime, he worked in secret in the Order as a novice master and teacher of theology. He studied at the Theological Faculty of Litom\u011b\u0159ice. In 1979, he obtained a licentiate in theology at the Theological Faculty of St. John the Baptist in Warsaw, Poland. In 1981/82, he was jailed in Plze\u0148. From 1986 to 1998 he was Provincial of the Dominicans in Bohemia and Moravia.[citation needed]\nAfter the fall of communism, Duka was elected Federal President of the Conference of Major Superiors and in the years 1992\u20131996, Vice-President of the Union of European Conferences of Major Superiors. From 1990\u201399, he was a lecturer in the Faculty of Theology at the Palack\u00fd University in Olomouc, teaching Introduction to Sacred Scripture and biblical anthropology.[citation needed]\nOn 6 June 1998 he was appointed bishop of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 and received episcopal ordination on 26 September 1998. On 13 February 2010, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him archbishop of Prague. Duka was formally installed in Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral. On his appointment, Duka said that:\n\n\"The Church must engage in a dialogue with society and must seek reconciliation with it. Twenty years ago, we were euphoric about freedom; today we live in an economic and financial crisis, and also to a certain extent in a crisis of values. So the tasks are going to be a little more difficult. But thanks to everything that\u2019s been done, it will not be a journey into the unknown.\"[4]\n\nOne of Archbishop Duka's chief concerns was the long-standing issue of the restitution of church property, which had been confiscated by the communist regime, and which were either never fully returned or for which the church was never compensated. The Czech Republic is one of the last countries in Europe not to have ratified a treaty with the Holy See.[4] After previous attempts at an agreement had failed \u2013 most notably in 2008 under Cardinal Vlk \u2013 the Czech government in mid-January 2012 agreed to a compensation plan, under which the country's seventeen churches, including Catholic and Protestant, would get 56% of their former property now held by the state \u2014 estimated at 75 billion koruna ($3.7 billion) \u2014 and 59 billion koruna ($2.9 billion) in financial compensation paid to them over the next thirty years. The state will also gradually stop covering their expenses over the next seventeen years.[5]\nOn 18 February Archbishop Duka was made Cardinal-Priest of Santi Marcellino e Pietro. On 21 April, he was appointed to the Congregation for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life and Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.[6]\nHe is chaplain general and grand cross of Order of Saint Lazarus.[7]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"\u010cesk\u00e9 katol\u00edky povede Duka, pape\u017e mu sv\u011b\u0159il \u00fa\u0159ad arcibiskupa\" (in Czech). iDnes. http://zpravy.idnes.cz/ceske-katoliky-povede-duka-papez-mu-sveril-urad-arcibiskupa-pqr-/domaci.asp?c=A100213_104937_domaci_jan.

From 1979 he combined his theological formation with the study of medical ethics at Leiden University.\nHe was ordained to priesthood in 1985 and was incardinated in the Diocese of Roermond.[3] Then he went to work as a curate in the parish of St. Anthony of Padua in Venlo Blerick.\nIn 1987 he completed a PhD degree in medicine, with a dissertation about euthanasia, subsequently taking another PhD degree in philosophy from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)[4] in Rome in 1990, with a thesis which considered genetic manipulation.[5]\nEijk also gained a master's degree and doctorate in theology at the Pontifical Lateran University of Rome. At the same time he taught moral theology at the seminary of Rolduc. From 1996, Eijk was Professor of moral theology at Lugano in Switzerland, in pontifical Faculty of Theology there. From 1997 to 2002 he was a member of the International Theological Commission.\n[edit] Bishop and Archbishop\nWhen Eijk was appointed as bishop of Groningen-Leeuwarden on 17 July 1999, he chose the motto Noli recusare laborem (\"Do not reject the work\"), taken from the last prayer of St. Martin.[6]\nEijk is known to be conservative. Some consider his views relatively extreme compared to the majority of the Dutch people,[7] especially his views on abortion and homosexuality. Others have argued that he has done nothing else but restate official Roman Catholic teachings.[8] In 2001 Wim Eijk suffered from a subdural hematoma, but he fully recovered.\nIn May 2008 Pope Benedict appointed Archbishop Eijk a member of the Congregation for the Clergy in addition to his duties as Archbishop of Utrecht.\nOn 18 February 2012, Pope Benedict XVI made Eijk a Cardinal along with 21 others.[9] He was created Cardinal-Priest of San Callisto. In addition to his duties on the Congregation for the Clergy, on 21 April Cardinal Eijk was appointed a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education.\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nAdrianus Johannes Simonis\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nHerman Willebrordus Woorts[10]\n13 February 2010\n\n\nTheodorus Cornelis Maria Hoogenboom[11]\n13 February 2010\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Cf.

He received a licentiate in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University and a doctorate in Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute. He was Professor of anthropology biblical exegesis; Dean of the Theological Institute of Assisi. He also served as undersecretary of Italian Episcopal Conference.\n[edit] Bishop\n\n\n\n\nThe coat of arms of H.E. Mgr Giuseppe Betori, as archbishop of Florence before his elevation to Cardinal, as seen on the fa\u00e7ade of the Palazzo arcivescovile\n\n\nHe was nominated by Pope John Paul II as Secretary General of the Italian Episcopal Conference and was simultaneously appointed Titular Bishop of Falerone. He received episcopal consecration on 6 May 2001. He was confirmed as Secretary General of the Italian Episcopal Conference, for a further five-year term, on 6 April 2006.\n[edit] Archbishop of Florence\nBetori was appointed to replace Ennio Antonelli, who had been appointed as president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, as archbishop of Florence by Pope Benedict XVI on 8 September 2008.[1] He received the pallium from Pope Benedict on 29 June 2009, the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul in Rome. [1]\nOn 5 November 2011 Archbishop Betori survived an apparent assassination attempt. An unidentified man confronted the archbishop outside his office, shot and wounded the prelate\u2019s secretary, and waved a gun at the archbishop before escaping. Fr Paolo Brogi, the archbishop's secretary, was reportedly in satisfactory condition after surgery to repair an abdominal wound. Archbishop Betori and witnesses stated that the gunman said something as he gestured toward the prelate with his firearm, but they could not understand his intent.[2]\nOn 10 December 2011 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture for a five-year renewable term.[3]\nOn 6 January 2012 it was announced that Betori would become a cardinal on 18 February. He was created Cardinal-Priest of San Marcello and will having voting rights in a possible conclave until his 80th birthday. In addition to his duties at Culture, Cardinal Betori was appointed a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Life and family issues\nIn a 2007 speech, he identified as the new enemies of Christianity: abortion, euthanasia, the negation of sexual duality and of a family based on marriage.[4]\n[edit] Ordination of homosexuals\nBetori has favored a ban on the ordination of homosexuals, saying the word discrimination can be used where there is a right, but that a vocation is not a right but a gift.[5]\n[edit] Relationship with Benedict XVI\nAccording to Abb\u00e9 Claude Barthe, Betori is a member of the paleoliberal wing of the Roman Curia, who along with Giovanni Battista Re, has constituted a kind of internal curial opposition to the decisions and policies of Pope Benedict XVI.[6]\n[edit] External links\n\nProfile of Giuseppe Betori on Catholic Hierarchy\n\n[edit] Sources\n\n\n^ \"Nomina dell\u2019Arcivescovo di Firenze (Italia)\" (in Italian).

Appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, Dolan is the tenth and current Archbishop of New York. Dolan also currently serves as the President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and was granted the titular position as Cardinal Priest of Nostra Signora di Guadalupe a Monte Mario (English: Our Lady of Guadalupe of Mount Mario) in Rome.\nDolan is widely known for his conservative values and charismatic media personality. He previously served as Archbishop of Milwaukee from 2002 to 2009, preceded by service as an Auxiliary Bishop of St. Louis from 2001 to 2002. Time Magazine named Dolan one of the \"100 Most Influential People in the World\" for 2012.\nCardinal Dolan has been named in the press as a likely papabile (a possible or likely successor) for election to the Papacy after Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation due to ill health, effective February 28, 2013.

The family later moved to Ballwin, a suburb of St. Louis, where they attended Holy Infant Roman Catholic Church.[9] He exhibited a strong interest in the Roman Catholic priesthood from an early age, once saying, \"I can never remember a time I didn't want to be a priest.\"[10] He would also pretend to celebrate Mass as a child.[11]\n[edit] Formation and Priesthood\nDolan entered Saint Louis Preparatory Seminary in Shrewsbury, Missouri in 1964, and later obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from Cardinal Glennon College. He was sent by Cardinal John Carberry to further his studies in Rome, where he attended the Pontifical North American College, and the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum from which he earned the degree of Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1976.\nTimothy Dolan is Edward Milfor's cousin. Dolan was ordained a priest by Edward O'Meara (Archbishop of Indianapolis, then Auxiliary Bishop of St. Louis) on June 19, 1976. He then served as an associate pastor at Cure' of Ars in Shrewsbury and Immacolata Roman Catholic Parish in Richmond Heights until 1979. From there he began his doctoral studies at The Catholic University of America under John Tracy Ellis with a concentration on the history of the Church in America; his thesis centered on Edwin Vincent O'Hara (Archbishop).[5] Dolan performed pastoral work upon his return to Missouri from 1983 to 1987. During this time he collaborated with Archbishop John May in reforming the archdiocesan seminary.\nHe was then named secretary of the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, D.C., serving as a liaison between American dioceses and the nunciature.[10] In 1992, Dolan was appointed Vice-Rector of his alma mater Kenrick-Glennon Seminary, where he also served as spiritual director and taught Church history. He was also an adjunct professor of theology at St. Louis University.\nFrom 1994 until June 2001, Dolan held the office of Rector of the Pontifical North American College in Rome.[12] During his tenure he published Priests for the Third Millennium, and taught at the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Angelicum.[10] He also was granted the title of Monsignor by Pope John Paul II in 1994.[13]\n[edit] Episcopal career\n[edit] Auxiliary Bishop of St. Louis\nOn June 19, 2001, Dolan was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of St. Louis and Titular Bishop of Natchesium by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 15 from Archbishop Justin Rigali, with Bishops Joseph Naumann and Michael Sheridan serving as co-consecrators. He chose as his episcopal motto: Ad Quem Ibimus, meaning, \"Lord, To Whom Shall We Go?\" (John 6:68)[5] taken from St. John\u2019s Gospel. 6:68.[1]\n[edit] Archbishop of Milwaukee\nOn June 25, 2002, Dolan was named the tenth Archbishop of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was formally installed at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist on August 28, 2002. Dolan said he was challenged and haunted by the sexual abuse scandal in that diocese, which broke during his tenure[14] There were over 8,000 reports of abuse by in excess of 100 staff.[15]\nHe took a special interest in priests and vocations,[16][17] and the number of seminary enrollments also rose during his tenure. In an outdoor Mass in September 2002, Dolan wore a \"cheesehead\" hat in tribute to the Green Bay Packers during his homily.[18] He also wrote Called to Be Holy (2005) and To Whom Shall We Go? Lessons from the Apostle Peter (2008), and co-hosted a television program with his brother called Living Our Faith.[11]\nIn June 2012 it was revealed that Dolan \"authorized payments of as much as $20,000 to sexually abusive priests as an incentive for them to agree to dismissal from the priesthood when he was the archbishop of Milwaukee\" and that \" a document unearthed during bankruptcy proceedings for the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and made public by victims\u2019 advocates reveals that the archdiocese did make such payments to multiple accused priests to encourage them to seek dismissal, thereby allowing the church to remove them from the payroll\".[19]\n[edit] Archbishop of New York\n\n\n\n\nCoat of Arms of Cardinal Dolan\n\n\nOn February 23, 2009, Dolan was appointed the tenth Archbishop of New York by Pope Benedict XVI.[20] The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, the nation's second-largest after the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, serves over 2.5 million Roman Catholics.[20] He succeeded Cardinal Edward Egan, who reached the mandatory retirement age of 75 in 2007. According to Dolan, he was informed of his appointment \"nine, ten days\" prior to the official announcement.[7] Recalling the phone call he received from Apostolic Nuncio Pietro Sambi, as opposed to his appointments as Auxiliary Roman Catholic Bishop of St. Louis and Archbishop of Milwaukee when Dolan was told that the Pope \"would like [him] to\" take the posts, he said that Sambi \"was quite factual\" in that he told him that \"the Pope had appointed [him]\" to New York, giving Dolan little choice other than to accept.[7]\nThe last time an Archbishop of New York was named without previously holding an office in the archdiocese's ranks came in 1939, when Pope Pius XII tapped close friend and then-Auxiliary Bishop Francis Spellman of the Archdiocese of Boston; however, Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor had served as an auxiliary to Cardinal Terence Cooke in the latter's capacity as head of the military ordinariate, not as Archbishop of New York.\nBefore Dolan's appointment, his name had been repeatedly mentioned as a possible successor to Cardinal Egan.,[21][22][23] but he downplayed such speculation, saying, \"Anytime there's kind of a major see that opens, what have we seen with Washington, Baltimore, Detroit, now New York, my name for some reason comes up. I'm flattered.\"[24] John Allen, Jr., Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, has noted that Pope Benedict's appointment of Dolan, like those of Donald Wuerl, Edwin O'Brien, and Dennis Schnurr, follows a pattern of choosing prelates \"who are basically conservative in both their politics and their theology, but also upbeat, pastoral figures given to dialogue.\"[25]\nDolan was formally installed as Archbishop of New York at St. Patrick's Cathedral on Easter Wednesday, April 15, 2009. He wore the pectoral cross used by his earlier predecessor John Hughes.[26] In attendance were eleven cardinals and several New York elected officials.[27]\nDolan received the pallium, a vestment worn by metropolitan bishops, from Pope Benedict XVI on June 29, 2009, in a ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica.[28]\nHe served as chairman of the board of directors of Catholic Relief Services (in which capacity he visited Ethiopia and India[29]) until his election as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, and he remains a member of the Board of Trustees of The Catholic University of America. Within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, he chairs the Priestly Life and Ministry Committee and sits on the Subcommittee on the Church in Africa. In November 2007, he lost the election for Vice President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, being defeated by Bishop Gerald Kicanas by a margin of twenty-two votes.\nDolan is also the apostolic visitor to Irish seminaries as part of the Apostolic visitation to Ireland following the publication of the Ryan and Murphy Reports in 2009. Dolan will form part of a team that will include Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the cardinal-archbishop emeritus of Westminster, who will inspect Cardinal Brady's archdiocese of Armagh, and Cardinal O'Malley of Boston who is to inspect Dublin. Toronto's Archbishop Thomas Christopher Collins will investigate Cashel, while Ottawa's Archbishop Terrence Prendergast will look at the archdiocese of Tuam. Following the conclusion, he will report their findings directly to Pope Benedict XVI.[30]\nOn January 5, 2011, he was appointed among the first members of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.[31]\nIn December 2011 Dolan was awarded the rank of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus by HRH Prince Victor Emmanuel.[32]\nIn 2011 he led a root and branch review of all structures and processes at the Pontifical Irish College in Rome. The report was highly critical of the college, as a result of which three Irish members of the staff were sent home and a fourth resigned. Four Irish archbishops, Cardinal Se\u00e1n Brady, Archbishop of Armagh; the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Diarmuid Martin; the Archbishop of Tuam, Dr Michael Neary, and the Archbishop of Cashel, Dr Dermot Clifford, were sent a copy of the visitation report by the Vatican. A response prepared for them said \"a deep prejudice appears to have coloured the visitation and from the outset and it led to the hostile tone and content of the report\".[33][34] The visitation report said \u201ca disturbingly significant number of seminarians gave a negative assessment of the atmosphere of the house\u201d. Staff, it added, were \u201ccritical about any emphasis on Rome, tradition, the magisterium, piety or assertive orthodoxy, while the students are enthusiastic about these features\u201d. A change in the staff was recommended. Elsewhere the report said: \u201cThe apostolic visitor noted, and heard from students, an \u2018anti-ecclesial bias\u2019 in theological formation.\u201d[35]\nOn December 29, 2011 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications for a five-year renewable term.[36] On April 21, 2011 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.[37]\nIn 2012, Dolan expressed his public disappointment in the HHS Mandate promulgated by American President Barack Obama. In a televised CBS interview, Dolan condemned the interference of the government in, what he viewed, as dismissal of right to religious conscience and religious freedom regarding the mandatory compulsion of religious groups and organizations to provide abortifacient drugs and contraception insurance coverage to its hired employees, while at the same time against the moral tenets of the Roman Catholic faith[38] After Barack Obama revised the rule, Dolan said the \"first decision was a terribly misguided judgment\" and said the new rule was \"a first step\".[39]\nOn January 24, 2012, Dolan went on a religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where he met Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Fouad Twal.[40][41]\n[edit] President of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops\nDolan was elected on November 16, 2010, to the presidency of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, becoming the first New York bishop to attain the post. Dolan replaced Cardinal Francis George, who did not run for re-election. In a vote of 128\u2013111, Dolan beat out nine others, including Bishop Gerald F. Kicanas of Tucson, Arizona, to win the three-year term.[42] Dolan took office two days later.\n[edit] Elevation into the College of Cardinals\nOn January 6, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI announced that Dolan would be created a cardinal at the consistory of the Church held on February 18, 2012.[43] Archbishop Dolan was formally elevated to the cardinalate by Pope Benedict XVI on February 18, 2012, receiving the traditional red biretta and gold ring during a ceremony in Saint Peter's Basilica.[44] The day prior, he addressed the pope and the College of Cardinals on spreading the faith in a secularized world.[45] He was created Cardinal-Priest of Nostra Signora di Guadalupe a Monte Mario. He was the first archbishop of New York not to receive the titular church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo since 1946, with that title still being held by Cardinal Egan, who is now archbishop emeritus of New York.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Conscience rights\nIn November 2009, Dolan signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration calling on evangelicals, Roman Catholics and Orthodox not to comply with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex marriage and other matters that go against their religious consciences.[46]\n[edit] Iraq war\nWhile noting that the \"Church has weighed in\" against the war in Iraq and capital punishment, Dolan defended not publicly opposing President George W. Bush's earlier appearance at Notre Dame by saying, \"Where President Bush would have taken positions on those two hot-button issues that I'd be uncomfortable with, namely the war and capital punishment, I would have to give him the benefit of the doubt to say that those two issues are open to some discussion and are not intrinsically evil...In the Catholic mindset, that would not apply to abortion.\"[47] He later said he will challenge any suggestion that Roman Catholics are unenlightened because they oppose gay marriage and abortion.[48]\n[edit] Sexual abuse scandal\nAs an auxiliary Roman Catholic bishop, Dolan was criticized for his handling of Roman Catholic priests accused of sexual misconduct, accused of being on a \"witch hunt\" to dismiss abusive priests.[10] He spoke with parishes, victims, and the media about the scandals, and invited victims of clerical abuse to come forward.[10] Commenting on his meetings with them, Dolan said, \"...[i]t is impossible to exaggerate the gravity of the situation, and the suffering that victims feel, because I've spent the last four months being with them, crying with them, having them express their anger to me.\"[49] In 2011, Dolan thanked Bill Donohue for a press release, reproduced on the Archdiocese of New York website, in which Donahue referred to the non-profit support group Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests as a \"phony victims' group\".[50] In May 2012, the New York Times revealed that he had also paid some individual abusive priests upward of $20,000 to leave the priesthood immediately, rather than initiate hostile laicization proceedings within the Church. Dolan said that the accusation that these were \"payoffs\" to protect accused priests was \"false, preposterous, and unjust\".[51]\n[edit] World trade center attacks aftermath\nDolan visited Ground Zero, the site of the September 11 attacks, on the following April 24.[52] After reciting the same prayer used by Benedict XVI during his visit to the United States, Dolan remarked, \"We will never stop crying. But it's also about September 12 and all the renewal, the rebuilding, hope, solidarity and compassion that symbolized this great community and still does.\"[52] Dolan condemned as a miscarriage of justice the release of the convicted Lockerbie bomber al-Megrahi and his reception in Libya.\n[edit] Published books\n\nDolan, Timothy M.

Appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, he has been the Archbishop of Berlin since 2 July 2011.[1]\n[edit] Earlier career\nWoelki was born on 18 August 1956 in Cologne as one of three children of parents who had been expelled from East Prussia at the end of the Second World War. He studied philosophy and theology at the Theological Faculties of the universities of Bonn and Freiburg im Breisgau.[2] On 14 June 1985 Cardinal Joseph H\u00f6ffner ordained him a priest for the Archdiocese of Cologne.[3]\nFrom 1985 to 1989 he was assistant priest at St Mary's Parish in Neuss. In 1989, he served for a short time as military chaplain in M\u00fcnster.[4] In 1990, he became private secretary to the Archbishop of Cologne.[2]\nFrom 1997 to 2011, he was Director of the \"Collegium Albertinum\", a residence for major seminarians of the archdiocese studying at the University of Bonn.[5] In 1999, Pope John Paul II granted him the rank of Chaplain of His Holiness, with the title of Monsignor. In 2000, he obtained a doctorate in theology, with a thesis on the ecclesiological place of the parish from the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross.[2]\nOn 24 February 2003, he was appointed Titular Bishop of Scampa and Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Cologne by Pope John Paul II. He was ordained a bishop on 30 March 2003 by Cardinal Joachim Meisner. He chose as his episcopal motto \"Nos sumus testes\" (We are witnesses), from Acts 5:32.[2]\nAs auxiliary bishop, he was given responsibility for the north of the archdiocese, with the cities of D\u00fcsseldorf and Wuppertal,[4] and was episcopal vicar for the doctrine of the faith and ecumenism, as well as being in charge of the permanent diaconate.[2]\nWithin the German Bishops' Conference, he became a member of the Commission for Vocations and Ministries of the Church and for Science and Culture. He was also appointed a consultor of the Holy See's Congregation for Catholic Education.\n[edit] Archbishop of Berlin\nOn 2 July 2011 Pope Benedict XVI ratified Woelki's election by the cathedral chapter of Berlin and appointed him Archbishop of Berlin.[2] The announcement came just two days after the death of Cardinal Georg Sterzinsky, whose resignation from the governance of the see had been accepted in February 2011.[4]\nWoelki has been criticised by some German politicians for his language on homosexuality, and his suitability for the post of archbishop in a city with a significant gay population. In an interview with the Catholic journalist George Schwikart he described homosexuality as an offence against the \"order of creation.\"[6][7][8]\nAfter his appointment he said, \"We will meet with each other\" when asked about the city's active gay community. \"I have respect and esteem for all people independent of heritage, skin colour and individual nature. I am open to all without reservations.\"[9] \"The Church is not a moral institution that goes around pointing its finger at people,\" Woelki said. \"The Church is for me a community of seekers and believers and the Church would like to help people find their happiness in life.\"\nHe was installed as archbishop of Berlin and took formal possession of his see on 27 August 2011.\nOne of Archbishop Woelki's first tasks was to prepare for the arrival of Pope Benedict XVI to Berlin in September 2011 on his state visit to Germany, his third visit to his home country since he was elected as Pope in 2005, the first as a state visit.\nHaving been appointed on 2 July, he waited almost a whole year, until the 2012 Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (29 June), to receive his pallium as metropolitan archbishop.\nA mere 132 days after his installation in Berlin it was announced on 6 January 2012 that Archbishop Woelki would be created a cardinal on 18 February along with 21 others in Rome,.[10] He was duly created Cardinal-Priest of San Giovanni Maria Vianney, becoming the youngest member of the College of Cardinals, in succession to Reinhard Marx of Munich. However, within the same year the creation of Baselios Cleemis Thottunkal and Luis Antonio Tagle as cardinals in November 2012 made Woelki the third youngest cardinal.\nWith his elevation Cardinal Woelki became eligible to vote in future papal conclaves, and will remain eligible to participate in any that begin before his 80th birthday on 18 August 2036. He was appointed a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education in addition to his duties in Berlin.\nIn a speech in June 2012 Cardinal Woelki said \u201cI believe we should agree and indeed we do agree on the fact that in judging this type of relation or relationship there is a big difference in judgement when people take responsibility for one another, when engaged in a long-term relationship as couples do in heterosexual relationships.\u201d [11][12]\nIn October 2012 Cardinal Woelki was nominated for a Respect Award by the Alliance Against Homophobia. He was praised by the group for speaking out in favour of a 'new cooperation with homosexuals in society' and officially meeting the Association for Gays and Lesbians for talks. This, the alliance said, had 'broken the tension between his Church and gays and lesbians and had laid the foundations for further exchange and for a constructive dialogue'. However Cardinal Woelki declined the nomination.[13] In December 2012 Cardinal Woelki unveiled a reorganisation in a 2 Dec pastoral letter to 105 local parishes. Cardinal Woelki said the archdiocese\u2019s finances had \u201cstabilized and improved\u201d thanks to \u201ccourageous and responsible decisions\u201d and \u201cgreat sacrifices\u201d by church institutions. He added that the archdiocese was forecast to lose a further third of its membership by 2030, and he said Catholic schools, nurseries, hospitals, elderly homes and information centers would also be reorganised to reflect this shift.[14]\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nGeorg Sterzinsky\nArchbishop of Berlin\n2 July 2011 \u2013 present\nIncumbent\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Other Pontifical Acts, 2 July 2011\n^ a b c d e f ZENIT (in German)\n^ \"Archbishop Rainer Maria Woelki\".

Appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, Tong Hon is also the titular Archpriest of the church of Regina Apostolorum in Rome.[2]\nIn his youth, Tong Hon spent ten years living in Huadu, Guangzhou before returning to Hong Kong.[3] He earned a master's degree in philosophy from the Chinese University of Hong Kong before going on to doctoral studies at the Pontifical Urbaniana University.[1] He was ordained a priest on 9 December 1966.[2] On 13 September 1996, he was appointed auxiliary bishop of Hong Kong.[1][2] He was named to the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples in 2003, after 24 years of service with their Holy Spirit Study Center in Hong Kong.[4] In March 2005, he traveled to Guangzhou on official business as a representative of the pope, along with other Hong Kong religious leaders; they were received at a banquet luncheon by Zhu Zhenzhong, chairman of the city's political consultative committee.[3]\nOn 30 January 2008, Pope Benedict XVI raised him to coadjutor bishop from his former position as the auxiliary bishop of the Hong Kong Diocese.[5] He had been named by the Church as being in line for Zen's job as early as 2006; however, he stated he felt little excitement at the prospect of taking up the post.[6] He assumed the post of Bishop of Hong Kong on 15 April 2009 with the retirement of Joseph Zen.[7]\nIn 2010 as part of his Christmas message, Bishop Tong Hon, called on the Chinese government to free Liu Xiaobo, activist Zhao Lianhai and all those who are in jail for promoting human rights. He also urged Beijing to release all the clergymen from the underground Church who are behind bars for demanding greater religious freedom in China. In his message, he expressed four dreams or aspirations he has for the future of his diocese, namely evangelisation, vocations, the Universal Church and acting as a bridge with mainland.[8]\nOn 18 February 2012 he was created Cardinal-Priest of Regina Apostolorum. He will have voting rights until his 80th birthday. In March 2012 Cardinal Tong Hon said that the diocese of Hong Kong would take up the role of \"Bridge Church\", the local Church is helping the mainland Church to have better formation, reconcile among themselves and achieve full communion with the Holy Father and the Universal Church. He went on to call for prayers for \"the reopening of the China-Vatican dialogue\" and for \"the graces bestowed upon the excommunicated, so that their early repentance could bring reconciliation in our Church and thus the wounds of our Church could be healed.\"[9] Cardinal Tong Hon said that he is confident that \"if Catholics in China were to enjoy full freedom of religious belief and activities, they would not only be able to contribute more fruitfully to the well-being of society, but would also earn for their Motherland a higher reputation in the international community.\" Regarding his elevation, he added that, \"I feel inadequate yet grateful\" and the appointment is both \"an honour and a responsibility\".[9]\nOn 21 April 2012 Cardinal Tong Hon was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Pontifical Council for Inter Religious Dialogue.\n[edit] See also\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of John Tong Hon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChristianity in China  portal\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Diocese of Hong Kong\nRoman Catholicism in Hong Kong\n\n[edit] References\n\n^ a b c Chang, Chih-ming (30 January 2008). \"\u6559\u5b97\u59d4\u4efb\u6e6f\u6f22\u4e3b\u6559\u70ba\u9999\u6e2f\u6559\u5340\u52a9\u7406\u4e3b\u6559\" (in Chinese).

Tagle is also the Professor of Dogmatic Synthesis at the Graduate School of Theology of San Carlos Seminary, the archdiocesan major seminary of Manila, and an Associate Professor of Systematic Theology at the Loyola School of Theology of the Ateneo de Manila University.[5]\nTagle is known for his charismatic nature[6] and views in line with Catholic teachings.[7][8][9][non-primary source needed][not in citation given]\nTagle has become involved in many social issues in the Philippines with emphasis on helping the poor and the needy while maintaining opposition against atheism,[10][11] abortion,[12] contraception,[13] and the Reproductive Health Bill.[5] Tagle currently wields strong religious and political influence as the country's primate, with an estimated 2.8 million professed Roman Catholics in the Archdiocese.[14]\nTagle was installed on the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe and is currently the head of the Metropolitan See of Manila along with its mother church, the Cathedral-Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, as both its metropolitan archbishop and archpriest.[15]\nTagle was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in a papal consistory on November 24, 2012 at Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life\n2 Bishop of Imus\n3 Archbishop of Manila\n4 Cardinal-Priest\n5 Coat of arms\n6 Bologna School affair\n7 Views\n8 Television\n9 Episcopal succession\n10 References\n11 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life\n\n\n\n\nA young Tagle in audience with Blessed Pope John Paul II and the future Pope Benedict XVI, Vatican Library, Rome.\n\n\nTagle's grandfather, Florencio, originally came from Imus, Cavite where the Tagles were known members of the principalia class [18] before the Philippine Revolution. Florencio was once injured by a bomb explosion during World War II while Tagle's grandmother made their living through an eatery diner or carinderia. Tagle was born in Manila to devoutly pious Roman Catholic parents, Manuel Tagle and Milagros Gokim, who previously worked for Equitable PCI Bank, Tagle is the firstborn child among his siblings and at the age of three, had already been able to recite the Holy Rosary. After attending elementary and secondary school at Saint Andrew's School in Para\u00f1aque, he was influenced by priestly friends to enter San Jose College Seminary, which gave him automatic entrance to Ateneo de Manila University.\nTagle earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Pre-Divinity from Ateneo de Manila University in 1977 and later, a Master of Arts in Theology degree at Loyola School of Theology.[5] Tagle then gained his Doctorate in Sacred Theology at the Catholic University of America from 1987 to 1991, Summa cum Laude. He wrote his dissertation under the direction of Joseph Komonchak on the notion of episcopal collegiality as it was developed at the Second Vatican Council and the influence of Pope Paul VI on this development.[19] In addition to this, Tagle also attended doctrinal courses at the Institute of Pope Paul VI University.[20]\nTagle was ordained priest of the Diocese of Imus on February 27, 1982. After ordination, he held the following positions: parochial vicar of St Augustine Parish \u2013 Mendez-Nu\u00f1ez, Cavite (1982\u20131983), spiritual director (1982\u20131983) and later rector (1983\u20131985) of the diocesan seminary of Imus. After having gone to Rome to study (1985\u20131992), he was appointed episcopal vicar for religious (1993\u20131995), then Parish Priest and Rector (1998\u20132001) of Our Lady of the Pillar Cathedral-Parish in Imus. He also taught theology at San Carlos Seminary (1982-1985) and Divine Word Seminary in Tagaytay City, Cavite.[21]\nBlessed Pope John Paul II appointed Tagle a member of the International Theological Commission (1997\u20132002) serving under then-Cardinal, President Joseph Ratzinger. He was a member of the Bologna-based editorial board (1995\u20132001) of the \"History of Vatican II\" project led by Alberto Melloni. Tagle is also currently the Chairman for the Episcopal Commission on the Doctrine of Faith.[20]\n[edit] Bishop of Imus\n\n\nOrdination History\n\n\nPriestly ordination\n\n\nDate of ordination\nFebruary 27, 1982\n\n\nPlace of ordination\nImus, Cavite\n\n\nEpiscopal consecration\n\n\nPrincipal consecrator\nJaime L. Cardinal Sin\n\n\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\nDecember 12, 2001\n\n\nIn 2001, Tagle was appointed Bishop of Imus on October 22 and consecrated on December 12.[22]\nAt the first gathering of bishops under Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, he made one of the seven speeches from the floor, about the inadequacy of the number of priests in the Philippines,[23][24] and also commented in a news conference that \"The first Sunday after my ordination as a priest, I said nine Masses, and that is regular in the Philippines.\"[25] Within the Episcopal Conference of the Philippines, he is the President of the Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith.\nTagle attended the 2008 International Eucharistic Congress in Quebec, Canada, for delivering a well-received catechesis on the importance of the Eucharist.\n[edit] Archbishop of Manila\n\n\n\n\nThe Cathedral-Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, metropolitan seat of Archbishop Tagle and the See of Manila, Philippines.\n\n\nThe Holy See appointed Tagle as the 32nd Archbishop of Manila on October 13, 2011, succeeding Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales and thus making him de facto Primate of the Philippines.\nAccording to the Reverend Father Catalino Arevalo, SJ (the first Asian member of the Vatican's International Theological Commission) that while Tagle was greatly favoured for the post by then-Papal Nuncio to the Philippines Edward Joseph Adams and Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales, several correspondent objections were submitted to Pope Benedict XVI, who in turn requested the allegations to be investigated.[26]\nTagle now governs the Metropolitan See of Manila with a population 2.8 million Roman Catholics, at a time when secularisation presents many challenges to the Church including changes in legislation regarding family life, birth control, and marriage.[27] As per the terms of canon law, Tagle took possession of the see of Manila within two months of his appointment. He was installed as Archbishop on December 12, 2011, to coincide with the feast day of Our Lady of Guadalupe and the tenth anniversary of his episcopal consecration.\n\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI meeting with then-Archbishop Tagle in the Apostolic Palace, Rome.\n\n\nPrior to his installation as Archbishop, Tagle made a religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land in October 2011. At the Church of Saint Catherine in Bethlehem, Tagle held a statue of the Infant Christ that was taken out for veneration in anticipation of Christmas. A large silver marker was also installed in the Yardenit baptism site in the Jordan River in honour of Tagle, where he participated in a tree-planting ceremony as a symbol of Filipino-Israeli friendship.[28]\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Tagle delivering the sermon at his enthronement at Manila Cathedral.\n\n\nOn February 9, 2012, Tagle attended a four-day conference called Symposium for Healing and Renewal at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Addressing 110 dioceses and 30 religious institutes, Tagle discussed the sex-abuse crises in Asia, where non-celibate priests acquiring mistresses is the more common problem than child-abuse cases.[29][30] Tagle maintained that a culture of shame perpetrated the problem and does not contribute to the solution.[31] As a result, the Holy See has launched an internet project to further help the cause of abused victims and prevent further crises.[32]\nTagle announced on February 13, 2012 that Manila Cathedral would temporarily be closed, citing structural work needed to maintain the integrity and strength of the building against possible earthquakes. In a circular, Tagle noted that the ground beneath the basilica is too soft, with the support columns not meeting engineering criteria, and that the Archdiocese has temporarily moved to San Fernando de Dilao Parish Church in Paco until repairs on the basilica are completed.[33]\nOn June 12, 2012, Archbishop Tagle was appointed a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education for a five-year renewable term.[34] That day, Tagle delivered a Catechetical speech at the 50th International Eucharistic Congress in Dublin, Ireland. He noted the importance of the Eucharist in relation to the Blessed Virgin Mary, particularly her maternal role in the Christian daily life and the practicality of living a life of sanctity and piety based on the beliefs regarding the Eucharist in the Catholic Church.[35] He also mentioned the various issues which divided the Church in Ireland and similar cases in Asia.[36][37]\nTagle received the pallium from Pope Benedict XVI on June 29, 2012 (the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul) along with several archbishops from various countries. Tagle was one of several Asian archbishops whom the Pontiff granted the pallium, one of whom being the Archbishop of Seoul Andrew Yeom Sou-jeong.\nOn August 4, 2012, Tagle delivered a public speech against the Reproductive Health Bill in EDSA, Manila, Philippines. In the speech, he advocated for women's rights by recognising their valued role as mothers and wives, deserving of genuine love and respect as reflections of God and a gift to mankind.[38][39] Tagle also spoke heavily against sexual prostitution, which he viewed as an affront to women's femininity.\nBenedict XVI named Tagle as one of the papally-appointed Synod Fathers for the 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelisation on September 18, 2012, .[40]\n[edit] Cardinal-Priest\n\n\nStyles of\nLuis Antonio G. Cardinal Tagle\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nManila\n\n\nOn Tuesday, October 23, 2012, the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone read a personalized letter by Pope Benedict XVI addressed to Archbishop Tagle intending to appoint him into the College of Cardinals.[41] In addition, Tagle noted that he was specifically instructed to remain silent with regards to the papal appointment as to not interfere the workings of the episcopal synod which were ongoing in Rome at the time. The papal letter relayed by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone did not officially confirm the Pontiff's formal decision on the cardinalate appointment.\nPope Benedict XVI named Archbishop Tagle to the College of Cardinals on Wednesday, October 24.[42] As Cardinal-Priest, he was assigned the titular church of San Felice da Cantalice a Centocelle during the papal consistory on November 24. Tagle is the seventh Filipino to be made Cardinal in the Catholic Church.[43] During the Cardinalate rites, Tagle was noted to be lacrimating over his titular appointment.\nOn November 30, 2012, upon his return to the Philippines, a grand thanksgiving Holy Mass was presided by Tagle at the San Fernando de Dilao Church in Paco, Manila, and was attended by the Philippine President, Benigno Aquino III, Vice-President Jejomar Binay and the Mayor of Manila, Alfredo Lim.\nOn January 9, 2013, during the feast of the Black Nazarene, Tagle issued a public televised homily at the Quirino Memorial Grandstand denouncing Cafeteria Catholics in the Philippines as \"enemies of the Church, false witnesses with pretentious devotion\", specifying those who claim to follow Jesus Christ but reject Roman Catholic doctrine by refusing to respect the sanctity of human life and natural law, while hinting at the recent passage of the Reproductive Health Bill into civil law. In addition, Tagle also spoke against nominal Catholics who worship their \"jewelry\" (wealth), but ignore Jesus Christ in the Blessed Sacrament.[44]\nOn January 31, 2013, Cardinal Tagle was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI to serve as a Member of the Presidential Committee of the Pontifical Council for the Family and the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants.[45]\nAs Pope Benedict XVI's pending abdication to the papacy, Cardinal Tagle is oftentimes seen as a papabile candidate for the Papal conclave of 2013. [46]\n[edit] Coat of arms\n\nTagle's personal coat of arms (sinister side) is impaled with that of the Archdiocese of Manila (dexter side).\nThe dexter side is derived from the arms of the City of Manila. The tower of Castille[47] signifies belief in the one God, its three windows professing devotion to the Trinity. The crescent moon is a symbol of the Blessed Virgin Mary as the Immaculate Conception, the principal patroness of the Philippines. On the lower portion, a sea-lion is clutching a cruciform staff is on an azure field. The sea-lion is originally a Spanish heraldic symbol for the Philippines, denoting it as an ultramar (overseas) possession. Today, the device is also found in many government seals (most prominently the Seal of the President of the Philippines).\nOn the other side, the top section portrays Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd and as a fisherman with the Gospel. The middle section portrays a classical symbol of Our Lady of the Pillar, the patroness of his previous diocese. The symbol consists of an Ionic column, surmounted by an ornate \"M\" as a symbol for the Virgin Mary, with a crown of twelve stars. The bottom depicts a carpenter's rule, which signifies Saint Joseph the Worker, along with a Lily flower, all in reference to the seminary which he once attended, the Jesuit-run San Jose Seminary at the Ateneo de Manila University.\nTagle's motto is taken from the John 21:7, Dominus Est! (\u201cIt is the Lord!\u201d).\n[edit] Bologna School affair\nTagle served for six years (1995\u20132001) on the editorial board (consisting of over 50 members) of the History of Vatican II project[20] coordinated by Alberto Melloni and Giuseppe Alberigo, both promoters of the Bologna School of ecclesiastical history which asserts that the Second Vatican Council was a \"rupture\" with the past. This position has been criticized by Pope Benedict XVI (amongst others) who holds the Vatican II was a \"continuity\" with the past.[48]\nThe five volume, 2,500 page History of Vatican II (completed after discussions at 14 international conferences with contributions from over 100 scholars) is seen as the seminal work on the Second Vatican Council although it has been criticized by some conservatives for providing an overly progressive reading of the council.[49] In particular, in 1999 Tagle, not yet a bishop, wrote the chapter in the fourth volume of the History of Vatican II dedicated to the so-called \u201cA November Storm: The Black Week\u201d which unfolded at the close of the council\u2019s third session in 1964, when several actions by Pope Paul VI caused alarm among reform forces. The Catholic commentator Sandro Magister reported that members of the Congregation for Bishops \u2013 who considered Tagle's candidacy for archbishop \u2013 only found out about his affiliation with the Bologna School after he was appointed.[50]\nIn 2005, the Archbishop of Astigi, Agostino Marchetto, then Secretary-General for the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants,[51] criticized the chapter written by Tagle, calling it \"unbalanced, journalistic, and lacking objectivity expected of a true historian\".[52]\nThe Vaticanologist John L. Allen, Jr. reported that Cardinal Marc Ouellet, the Holy See's prefect for the Congregation for Bishops and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Pope Benedict XVI, maintains his \u201cfull support\" for Tagle. Allen also reported that a Vatican official indicated that he read Tagle\u2019s 1999 essay \u2013 after media reports highlighted it \u2013 and found nothing objectionable. In fact, he was impressed by Tagle\u2019s defense of Paul VI (Tagle wrote that Paul followed a strategy of \u201clistening to all views, especially opposing ones\u201d and was willing to \u201csacrifice his personal popularity to save the council and its future\u201d). This official also said that it is difficult to suggest Tagle is opposed to Pope Benedict\u2019s reading of the council since one of the sources Tagle cited was the writings of Joseph Ratzinger.[53]\nIn a 2012 televised interview by Salt + Light Television, Tagle maintained that there was no rupture in the magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church in comparison to the pre-Second Vatican Council. Furthermore, he added that he does not subscribe to the \"Rupture theory\" that the Catholic Church before 1962 is disconnected from the present church.[54]\n\n[edit] Views\nIn his intervention at the 2012 General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Tagle spoke of the need for an attitude of humility, respectfulness and silence on the part of the Catholic Church as to \"become more credible among its followers[55] and elaborated on it in an interview on Vatican Radio.[56]\n[edit] Television\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite his appointment as Archbishop of Manila, Tagle is still the presenter of The Word Exposed, a Catholic television programme produced by the Jesuit Communications Foundation, which also maintains a non-official FaceBook account while all his official correspondences and press releases are maintained and released by the Archdiocesan Chancery of Manila.[57]\nHe is also co-presenter on Kape't Pandasal (\"Coffee and Prayer\", a pun on the term kape't pandesal or \"coffee and salted bread\"), an early morning religious inspirational programme partly produced by the same network, currently furnished and broadcasted by ABS-CBN.[58]\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nJaime Sin\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Biography of The Most Reverend Luis Antonio G.

He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Marius Maziers on 20 September 1969 and worked as a curate in the Archdiocese of Bordeaux before entering the Vatican's diplomatic service in 1975. He was secretary of the nunciatures to the Dominican Republic (1975\u20131978) and to Lebanon (1979\u20131983). Tauran became an official of the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church in 1983, and then participated in special missions in Haiti (1984), and Beirut and Damascus (1986). He was also a member of the Vatican delegation to the meetings of the Conference on European Security and Cooperation, Conference on Disarmament in Stockholm, and Cultural Forum in Budapest and later Vienna.\n[edit] Secretary for Relations with States\nOn 1 December 1990, Tauran was appointed Secretary for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State and Titular Archbishop of Thelepte by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on 6 January 1991 from John Paul II himself, with Archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Justin Francis Rigali serving as co-consecrators, in St. Peter's Basilica. As Secretary, Tauran essentially served as the foreign minister of the Vatican. In regards to the Iraqi conflict, he once emphasized the importance of dialogue and the United Nations,[1] and said that \"a unilateral war of aggression would constitute a crime against peace and against the Geneva Conventions\".[2]\n[edit] Archivist and Librarian of the Holy Roman Church\nHe was created Cardinal-Deacon of Sant'Apollinare alle Terme by Pope John Paul in the consistory of 21 October 2003. On the following 24 November, he was named Archivist and Librarian of the Holy Roman Church, overseeing the Vatican Secret Archives and Vatican Library.\nIn late 2003, Tauran mourned the \"second-class\" treatment of non-Muslims in \"many Muslim countries,\" especially Saudi Arabia.[1]\nRepresenting the Pope, Tauran attended the March 2005 dedication of the new Holocaust museum at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. That same year, he was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] President of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue\nIn spite of having Parkinson's disease, Tauran was appointed as President of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue on 25 June 2007, showing that the disease was not getting worse and he was able to handle more responsibility. He took over this position on 1 September 2007. In this post, he is also in charge of the Commission for Religious Relations with Muslims.\nIn addition to his duties as president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, he is a member of the Secretariat of State (Second Section); the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith; the Congregation for the Oriental Churches; the Congregation for Bishops; the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity; the Pontifical Council for Culture; the Apostolic Signatura; the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See; the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, and the Cardinal Commission for the Supervision of the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR).\nHe is a friend of Anglican Dr. John Andrew, former rector of St. Thomas Church in New York City. For Andrews' fiftieth anniversary of his ordination in late June 2007, Cardinal Tauran traveled to New York and served as a guest preacher.[1]\nHe was a friend of Anglican Dr. Roger Greenacre, former Precentor of Chichester Cathedral in England. For Greenacre's fiftieth anniversary of his ordination at Michaelmas (the Feast of the Archangel Saint Michael) of 2005, Cardinal Tauran traveled to Chichester and served as a guest preacher.[citation needed] Cardinal Tauran delivered a tribute at Greenacre's Memorial Requiem in Chichester Cathedral on 23 September 2011.[citation needed]\nAccording to an online news story article written by Cindy Wooden of Catholic News Service (CNS), posted on 3 April 2012:\n\n\"If the openness, questioning and hopes of young people are encouraged and guided, they become a stimulus for the adults around them to take seriously the challenges of building a better world marked by dialogue and acceptance, a Vatican official told Buddhists around the world. ... \"Young people are an asset for all societies,\" said Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, in a message marking the upcoming Buddhist celebration of Vesakh, a feast commemorating the key events in the life of the Buddha. ... Cardinal Tauran said that as students around the world increasingly have classmates with different beliefs from their own, schools have a responsibility to guide the young in reflecting on their own beliefs, learning about the beliefs and religious practices of others and growing in respect for others.\"[3]\n\n[edit] Views\n[edit] War in Iraq\nCardinal Tauran was a fierce critic of the United States over questions of war and peace. He described the American-led invasion of Iraq as a \u201ccrime against peace\u201d and a violation of international law if undertaken.[4] He asserted that the facts speak for themselves on Iraq and that paradoxically Christians were better protected under Saddam's dictatorship.[5]\n[edit] Relations with Hindus\nEach year the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue sends a message, signed by its President, to Hindus for the feast of Diwali, which is celebrated during the month of October. In the 2009 message, Tauran called for the promotion of integral development, protection of human life and respect for the dignity and fundamental rights of the person.[6]\nThe Council sends similar messages each year on the occasion of the feasts of Eid ul-Fitr (Islam) and Vesak (Buddhism).\n[edit] Sharia\nIn a breakfast meeting with journalists, Tauran said Rowan Williams had been \u201cmistaken and naive\u201d for suggesting that some aspects of Sharia law in Britain were unavoidable.[7] He also said that he did not want an impression to grow that there are different classes of religion.[8]\n[edit] References\n\n^ a b c Whispers in the Loggia.

On Wednesday, January 19, 2011, Cardinal Nicora was named by Pope Benedict XVI as the President of the four-person Executive Board of the Vatican's new Financial Information Authority. The new agency, by mandate of an Apostolic Letter, is charged with monitoring the monetary and commercial activities of Vatican agencies, such as the Governorate of Vatican City State, the Vatican Bank, the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, and smaller agencies such as the Vatican Pharmacy, the Vatican Supermarket, and the Vatican Museums.\n[edit] Biography\nNicora was born in Varese, Italy and ordained a priest in 1964. Prior to being ordained, he had earned a license in Canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome as well as a license in theology from the Theological Faculty in Milan. After his ordination, he became a professor of canon law at the Theological Seminary of Venegano.\nNicora first became a bishop in 1977, when he was appointed auxiliary bishop of Milan and titular bishop of Furnos Minor. Nicora oversaw the 1984 revision of the concordat, between Italy and the Vatican. From 1992 to 1997, he served as bishop of Verona. In 2002, Nicora became President of Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, where his responsibility was administering the Vatican's income from properties. This position is comparable to that of a chief financial officer in a corporation.

He was previously the Archbishop of Portland (Oregon) from 1986 to 1995, and then Archbishop of San Francisco from 1995 to 2005. Levada was elevated to the cardinalate in 2006. The Cardinal's resignation as Prefect for reasons of age was accepted on Monday, July 2, 2012 (having reached 75 years of age in 2011, the canonical age at which all Catholic Bishops must submit an offer of resignation to the Pope). He was succeeded that same day by Bishop Gerhard Ludwig M\u00fcller of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Regensburg in Regensburg, Germany, who was named an Archbishop.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and clerical formation\n2 Priestly ministry\n3 Episcopal ministry\n4 US sexual abuse scandal involvement\n5 Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith\n\n5.1 Head of the Ecclesia Dei Commission\n5.2 Reception of Traditional Anglicans\n\n\n6 Views\n\n6.1 Dissident theologians\n6.2 Norms of moral law\n6.3 Life issues\n6.4 Inclusive language\n6.5 Liturgical music\n6.6 Interfaith dialogue with Jews\n6.7 Catholic politicians\n6.8 Islam\n6.9 Tridentine Mass\n6.10 Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith\n6.11 Position on homosexual activity\n6.12 Position on gay civil partnerships\n\n\n7 Episcopal succession\n8 See also\n9 References\n10 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and clerical formation\nWilliam Joseph Levada was born in Long Beach, California, to Joseph and Lorraine (n\u00e9e Nunez) Levada, both natives of Concord, California. His older sister, Dolores, died on May 21, 2007.\nHis great-grandparents came from Portugal[1] and Ireland, and immigrated to the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1860s. He grew up in Long Beach and Houston, Texas, attended St. Anthony High School Long Beach and then St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles.[2][3]\nFrom 1958 to 1961, Levada studied at the North American College and did his theological studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.[4] He was ordained to the priesthood on December 20, 1961, by Archbishop Martin John O'Connor, rector of the Pontifical North American College and president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, in St. Peter's Basilica.\n[edit] Priestly ministry\nFrom 1961 until around 1966, Levada worked in parishes in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, including St. Monica's Church in Santa Monica. He also taught high school and worked in college campus ministry.\nAfter this, he returned to Rome and continued his studies at the North American College. He received a doctorate in sacred theology magna cum laude. His 1971 dissertation was written under Francis A. Sullivan, SJ. In the early 1970s, he returned to the United States and taught theology at St. John's Seminary School of Theology in Camarillo, California. During this time he was also named the first Director of Continuing Education for the Clergy in the archdiocese, and received the title Monsignor.\nFrom 1976 to 1982, Levada was an official of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in the Vatican, having been recommended by Cardinal Joseph Bernardin. During this time, he taught part-time at the Pontifical Gregorian University. At the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Levada served under three popes (Pope Paul VI, Pope John Paul I, and Pope John Paul II), and under two prefects of the CDF (Cardinals Franjo Seper and Joseph Ratzinger).\nIn 1982, Cardinal Timothy Manning, Archbishop of Los Angeles, named Levada as the Executive Director of the California Catholic Conference of Bishops in Sacramento.\n[edit] Episcopal ministry\nLevada was appointed an auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles and titular bishop of Capreae on March 25, 1983, and was consecrated by Cardinal Manning (with Bishops John J. Ward and Juan Arzube as co-consecrators) in the Cathedral of St. Vibiana on May 12. In 1984 he was appointed episcopal vicar of Santa Barbara County. In 1986 he was appointed chancellor and moderator of the archdiocesan curia. Serving under Cardinal Roger Mahony, Levada reorganized the internal structure of the archdiocese.\nOn July 1, 1986, Levada became the Archbishop of Portland in Oregon. During his tenure in Portland, Levada helped to revitalize Mount Angel Seminary in St. Benedict, Oregon; Levada briefly taught at the seminary as well. Other accomplishments in Portland included reorganizing Catholic Charities, working in outreach to the Hispanic Catholic community, and renovating St. Mary\u2019s Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. In 1987 he was appointed by Cardinal Ratzinger, whom Pope John Paul II asked to develop the project for a new Catechism of the Catholic Church, to serve on its Editorial Committee, a group of 7 bishops whose task it was to prepare a draft of the catechism, conduct a consultation among the bishops of the world and many scholars, and develop a final text under the direction of the Commission of 12 Cardinals of which Cardinal Ratzinger was President\nOn August 17, 1995, Levada was appointed coadjutor archbishop of San Francisco, and on December 27 of the same year he succeeded John Raphael Quinn as the archbishop.\nIn November 2000, Levada was appointed one of the members of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, where he again served under Cardinal Ratzinger. This was a part-time task which let him remain in California.\nAlso in 2000, Levada became the Bishop Co-Chair of the Anglican-Roman Catholic dialogue in the United States. In November 2003, Levada was appointed as Chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee on Doctrine. This was a three-year term, but he resigned in 2005 due to his new duties in Rome and was replaced by Arthur J. Serratelli, Bishop of Paterson.\nOn September 18, 1998, he was principal consecrator at the episcopal ordination of Monsignor John C. Wester as an auxiliary Bishop of San Francisco. On January 30, 2003, he was again principal consecrator of Monsignor Ignatius C. Wang as a second auxiliary Bishop of San Francisco. Bishop Wang, a native of Beijing, is the first Chinese and first Asian Bishop to be ordained for a diocese in the United States.\nThe date of Levada's transfer from Archbishop of San Francisco was August 17, the 10th anniversary of the announcement of his appointment as archbishop.\nHe also serves as Grand Prior of the Northwest Lieutenancy (USA) of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, and as Conventual Chaplain for the Western Association (USA) of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta.\n[edit] US sexual abuse scandal involvement\nMain article: Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Portland\nSome have criticized how Levada dealt with priests who had committed sexual abuse in Portland and in San Francisco.[5][6]\nIn 1985, as a contact of Boston\u2019s Cardinal Law about the issue, Levada was given a report by a three-man panel headed by Father Tom Doyle about medical, legal, and moral issues posed by abusive clerics in an attempt to present the report to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops at their June 1985 meeting. Few days later Father Doyle was informed by Levada that their report would not be heard by the bishops. Weeks later, Doyle was demoted from his post in Vatican embassy.[7]\nIn an 2008 interview for Beliefnet.com Levada said:\n\n\u201cI personally do not accept that there has been a broad base of bishops guilty of aiding and abetting pedophiles\u2026If I thought there were, I would certainly want to talk to them about that.\u201d[8]\n\nIn a response father Tom Doyle said:\n\n\u201dI vividly recall briefing Levada in May, 1985 when he was an auxiliary bishop, about the sexual abuse crisis. I also have seen volumes of documents and sworn testimony from depositions that clearly shows that most, probably all, bishops clearly knew that priests were raping and otherwise sexually abusing kids as far back as the 40's\u2026.and I limit it to that era because I have not gone beyond that in studying documents. So, Levada\u2019s statement is either an outright lie or evidence of a very narrow understanding and perception of reality.[9]\n\nAs archbishop in Portland, Levada removed Father Joseph Baccellieri, a parish priest accused of child molestation in 1992. Levada allowed him to return to duty 1994 after Baccellieri had undergone therapy and \"with the proviso that he couldn't be around children and couldn't counsel adults or children\". Levada did not inform parishioners or law enforcement about the allegations. Baccellieri went on to serve as a pastor or associate pastor in four Portland-area parishes between 1994 and 2001, when he went on leave to study canon law.[10]\nIn February 2013, Levada told the media that Cardinal Roger Mahony should help select the next pope, even though Mahony had obstructed the investigation of child abusers while he headed the church in Los Angeles in the 1980s.[11]\n[edit] Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith\n\n\nStyles of\nWilliam Joseph Levada\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nSan Francisco (emeritus)\n\n\nOn May 13, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Levada as his own successor in the post of Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the principal defender of the moral and theological doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, sometimes acting as chief prosecutor against members of the Church who have strayed from those values.\nIt was commonly speculated that the pope's reasons for choosing Levada may have included the fact that Levada had been a principal editor of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the fact that the two of them had worked together at the CDF in the past, and the pope's desire to have an American heading the CDF since one of its major roles today is to deal with the fallout from the sexual abuse scandal.\nLevada resigned as Archbishop of San Francisco effective August 17, 2005, the tenth anniversary of the announcement of his appointment as coadjutor to San Francisco. One of his last official duties as metropolitan bishop was to serve as principal consecrator of Clarence Richard Silva as the new Bishop of Honolulu, since Honolulu is a suffragan diocese of the San Francisco ecclesiastical province. Levada was replaced in San Francisco as Archbishop by high school classmate George Niederauer.\nOn March 24, 2006, Benedict XVI elevated Levada to the College of Cardinals, making him eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on June 15, 2016. Levada was named Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica.\nIn addition to his position as Prefect of the CDF, Cardinal Levada is the president of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, the International Theological Commission, and the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei.[12] Levada's other curial positions include membership in the Congregation for Bishops, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, and the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.[13] On January 5, 2011 he was appointed among the first members of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.[14]\n[edit] Head of the Ecclesia Dei Commission\nCardinal Levada, who was already a member of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, the organ of the Holy See charged with seeking the reconciliation of the Society of St. Pius X and similar groups with Rome and regulating celebration of the Sacraments according to the 1962 texts in Latin, was appointed its President on July 8, 2009,[15] in accordance with Pope Benedict XVI's motu proprio Ecclesiae Unitatem, which makes the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ex officio head of the Ecclesia Dei Commission.[16] However, the Commission has its own staff, consisting of a Secretary and officials.[17]\nOn May 13, 2011 the instruction Universae Ecclesiae was published which clarified certain aspects of Summorum Pontificum. Cardinal Levada, as president of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei signed the document which was approved by Pope Benedict XVI on April 8 and is dated April 30, the Memorial feast of Pope Saint Pius V. The instruction also contains within it the fruits of the triennial examination of the application of the law, which had been planned from the outset.\n[edit] Reception of Traditional Anglicans\nOn October 20, 2009, Cardinal Levada and Archbishop Joseph DiNoia held a press conference in which they announced that Pope Benedict was preparing to release an apostolic constitution that was later presented under the title Anglicanorum coetibus that would allow Anglicans, both laity and clergy, to join the Catholic Church and maintain their corporate identity. They stated that \"pastoral oversight and guidance will be provided for groups of former Anglicans through a Personal Ordinariate, whose Ordinary will usually be appointed from among former Anglican clergy.\"[18]\nThe press release envisaged that married Anglican clergy who join the Catholic Church will be ordained to the priesthood, but excluded ordination to the episcopate: \"Historical and ecumenical reasons preclude the ordination of married men as bishops in both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. The Constitution therefore stipulates that the Ordinary can be either a priest or an unmarried bishop.\" During the conference, Cardinal Levada compared the new ordinariates to the ordinariate that in many countries exist for the pastoral care of the military forces. The move is to result in an Anglican liturgical rite within the Catholic Church. The personal ordinariates will be established after consultation with the episcopal conferences. It has not beern indicated whether there is to be only one such personal ordinariate in a country, as for military ordinariates, or whether there could be a distinct ordinariate for each of several Anglican groups within a country who join the Catholic Church.\nA joint statement on the new protocol from Archbishop Vincent Nichols of Westminster and the Anglican Communion's head, Archbishop Rowan Williams of Canterbury, occurred at the same time in London.[19]\nOn October 31, 2009, Cardinal Levada responded to speculation that the rule whereby in some Eastern Catholic Churches ordination to the diaconate and priesthood is open to married men as well as to celibates will apply also to the personal ordinariates for former Anglicans. He made it clear that the canonical discipline of the Western Catholic Church applies to these ordinariates. Objective criteria for circumstances in which a dispensation from celibacy may be requested will be worked out jointly by the personal ordinariate and the episcopal conference.\nThe apostolic constitution on the personal ordinariates for former Anglicans will contain the following rule:\n\n\u00a71. Those who ministered as Anglican deacons, priests, or bishops, and who fulfil the requisites established by canon law and are not impeded by irregularities or other impediments may be accepted by the Ordinary as candidates for Holy Orders in the Catholic Church. In the case of married ministers, the norms established in the Encyclical Letter of Pope Paul VI Sacerdotalis coelibatus, n. 42 and in the Statement \"In June\" are to be observed. Unmarried ministers must submit to the norm of clerical celibacy of CIC can. 277, \u00a71. \u00a72. The Ordinary, in full observance of the discipline of celibate clergy in the Latin Church, as a rule (pro regula) will admit only celibate men to the order of presbyter. He may also petition the Roman Pontiff, as a derogation from can. 277, \u00a71, for the admission of married men to the order of presbyter on a case by case basis, according to objective criteria approved by the Holy See.\".[20]\n\n[edit] Views\nCardinal Levada's views generally reflect the official teachings of the Catholic Church.\n[edit] Dissident theologians\nOn Catholics who dissent from Catholic teachings:\n\nCatholic theology does not recognize the right to dissent, if by that we mean adopting conclusions which are contrary to the clear teachings of the authoritative, infallible magisterium and which are presented to the public in such a way as to constitute equivalently an alternative personal magisterium.[21]\n\n[edit] Norms of moral law\nIn his doctoral dissertation of 1970 in which Levada treated the question of the infallibility of specific moral norms of the natural law, he wrote:\n\n\"The human process of formulating moral norms is marked by an essential dependence upon the data of human experience.... The variabilities which marked the human process of its discovery and formulation made such particular applications inherently unsuited to be considered for infallible definition.... For such formulations must remain essentially open to modification and reformulation based upon moral values as they are perceived in relation to the data and the experience which mark man's understanding of himself.... Even though there is nothing to prevent a council or a pope from extending [infallibility] to questions of the natural moral law from the point of view of their authority to do so, nevertheless the \"prudential\" certitude which characterizes the non-scriptural norms of the natural law argues against such an extension....The Church has never in fact made an infallible declaration about a particular norm of the natural moral law.\"[22]\n\n[edit] Life issues\nIn March 1995, Pope John Paul II explicitly confirmed that the Church's teachings against murder (par. 57), abortion (par. 62), and euthanasia (par. 65) were specific moral norms which the Church's ordinary and universal Magisterium had protected with infallibility.\nWithin 68 days, Levada publicly stated, in contrast to the conclusion[clarification needed] he reached in 1970, that the Catholic Church's teaching regarding the immorality of directly-willed abortion had been infallibly taught by the ordinary and universal magisterium:\n\nThe individual politician, like any Catholic, who is at odds with the teaching of the Church about the principle involved, i.e., that abortion constitutes the killing of innocent human life and is always gravely immoral (cf. Evangelium Vitae, nn. 57\u201362), has an obligation to reflect more deeply on the issue, in the hope of allowing the persuasive character of this infallibly taught teaching to become part of his belief and value system. I say infallibly taught not because Pope John Paul II has assumed in Evangelium Vitae the special prerogative recognized for individual papal teachings in the First Vatican Council, but rather because he has called attention explicitly to the fact that Catholic teaching on abortion has been an infallible doctrine of the Church by virtue of the universal ordinary Magisterium, recognized for the teachings of the Pope and worldwide college of bishops together by the Second Vatican Council.[23]\n\nSome argue[who?] that the two statements indicate a change in Levada's views, suggesting that he altered his views to conform to the Pope's statement.\nIn Evangelium Vitae, John Paul was writing about a specific principle of natural law, found in Scripture, and declaring that the principle is protected by infallibility. Since the passage in Levada's dissertation refers to principles of natural law that are not found in Scripture, there is really no conflict between the two viewpoints.\n[edit] Inclusive language\nIn 1987, Levada and six other bishops were chosen by Cardinal Ratzinger to edit the forthcoming Catechism of the Catholic Church. When the Catechism was completed in 1993, the first English translation was very loose and used a great deal of inclusive language. Along with Archbishop Eric D'Arcy of Hobart, Australia and Fr. John Wall, Levada insisted that this be replaced with a more literal translation, and it was a new and more literal translation that was published in English in 1994. Levada also authored the glossary for the second edition of the Catechism.\n[edit] Liturgical music\nWhile serving as Archbishop of Portland (Oregon) from 1986 to 1995, he was, ex officio, the chair of the board of directors for OCP (formerly known as Oregon Catholic Press). He oversaw its rapid growth to become the largest publisher of English liturgical music, hymnals, missals and support materials for the Catholic Church. He continues to serve on its board of directors.[24]\n[edit] Interfaith dialogue with Jews\nAccording to rabbi David Rosen, Cardinal Levada made it clear that there was intrinsic value in conducting interfaith dialogue with Jews even without any ulterior motives of proselytizing. He also made a clear distinction between \"witnessing,\" or sharing the New Testament, and proselytizing, which was wrong.[25]\n[edit] Catholic politicians\n\nA Catholic, to be in full communion with the faith of the Church, must accept this teaching about the evil of abortion and euthanasia. This reflects the Church's official teaching on the matter.[26]\n\n[edit] Islam\n\nIf both Islam and Christianity view themselves as universal and missionary, it does not mean an impasse but an opportunity to search further into the mystery of that faith to see how it resonates and relates to the other's faith.[27]\n\n[edit] Tridentine Mass\nSome Traditionalist Catholics complained about Levada's refusal to allow Tridentine Masses to be celebrated publicly in his archdiocese, saying that this was against Pope John Paul II's motu proprio Ecclesia Dei.[28]\n[edit] Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith\nConcerning the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, he has said that if corrections took place by peers, if there were a functioning process of serious review and assessment in light of Catholic doctrine by theologians competent to evaluate the work of one of their own, there would be much less work for members of the Congregation.[citation needed]\n[edit] Position on homosexual activity\nAddressing the issue of homosexual activity, Levada led a march of approximately 1,000 people through the streets of San Francisco in April 2005 to protest against gay marriage. For his denunciation of same-sex marriage, Levada has been criticized by LGBT associations. He wrote in 2004:\n\nHeterosexual marriage, procreation and the nurturing of children form the bedrock of the family, and the family unit lies at the heart of every society. To extend the meaning of marriage beyond a union of a man and a woman, their procreative capacity, and their establishment of family represents a misguided understanding of marriage.[29]\n\n[edit] Position on gay civil partnerships\nIn 1997, the City of San Francisco passed a law that all companies must provide the same benefits for domestic partners as for their spouses. Levada objected that this violated Catholic teaching on the unique status of marriage, but the city would not budge. Levada stated that unmarried employees of the archdiocese could designate any person sharing the same address as their beneficiary. This complied with the statute while avoiding a privileged status for unmarried domestic partnerships.[30]\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nTimothy Manning\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nTod David Brown\nApril 3, 1989\n\n\nAlexander Joseph Brunett\nJuly 6, 1994\n\n\nJohn Charles Wester\nSeptember 18, 1998\n\n\nJoseph Anthony Pepe\nMay 31, 2001\n\n\nIgnatius Chung Wang\nJanuary 30, 2003\n\n\nClarence Richard Silva\nJuly 21, 2005\n\n\nJoseph Augustine DiNoia, O.P.\nJuly 11, 2009\n\n\n[edit] See also\n\nList of the Catholic bishops of the United States#American bishops serving outside the United States\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Distinguished Americans & Canadians of Portuguese Descent\". http://www.portuguesefoundation.org/famous.htm.

In 1945 he and his family sought refuge in Austria and later fled to Argentina in 1948. He entered the Congregation of the Mission, more commonly known as the Lazarists, in Buenos Aires in 1952, making his perpetual profession in 1957. Rode studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, and at the Catholic Institute of Paris, from where he obtained his doctorate in theology in 1968.\n[edit] Pastoral work\nHe was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Andr\u00e9-Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Defebvre, CM, on 29 June 1960 in Paris. In 1965, at the request of his superiors, Rode returned to Yugoslavia, where he worked as vice-pastor, director of studies and provincial visitor of the Lazarists, and professor of fundamental theology and missionology at the Theological Faculty of Ljubljana.\n[edit] Curial work\nIn 1978 he was made consultor of the Secretariat for Non-Believers in the Roman Curia, being transferred to that dicastery in 1981 and rising to become its Undersecretary in 1982. During this time, he assisted in the organization of some significant dialogue sessions with European Marxists. When Pope John Paul II united the Pontifical Council for Culture and Pontifical Council for Non-Believers in 1993, he appointed Rode Secretary of the new Pontifical Council for Culture. As Secretary, he served as the second-highest official of that dicastery, under Paul Poupard.\n[edit] Archbishop\nOn March 5, 1997, Rode was appointed Archbishop of Ljubljana, and thus de facto Primate of Slovenia, by Pope John Paul. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 6 April from Archbishop Alojzij \u0160u\u0161tar, with Archbishops Franc Perko and Aloysius Ambrozic serving as co-consecrators, in the Cathedral of Ljubljana. Rode successfully guided the negotiations for a new concordat to final approval in 2004.\n[edit] Cardinal\nHe was created Cardinal-Deacon by Pope Benedict XVI on 24 March 2006. His motto is a phrase in Old Slovene, \"Stati inu obstati\" (To Exist and Persevere / To Stand and Withstand), taken from the Catechism of Primo\u017e Trubar, which is also inscribed on the Slovenian 1 euro coin.\n[edit] Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life\nHe returned to the Roman Curia upon his nomination as Prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life on 11 February 2004. Pope Benedict XVI later created Rode Cardinal-Deacon of S. Francesco Saverio alla Garbatella in the consistory of 24 March 2006. In January 2011, he retired as the prefect of the Congregation.[3][4]\nHe is a member of the various offices in the Roman Curia. These are: congregations of Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments; for Bishops; for the Evangelization of Peoples; for Catholic Education; Pontifical Council for Culture and the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei. He will be a member of these dicasteries until his 80th birthday on 23 September 2014, when he loses the right to vote in a Papal Conclave.\nHe is fluent in Slovene, Spanish, Italian, French, and German.\n[edit] Allegations of fatherhood\nAllegations of Rode's fatherhood surfaced in the Slovenia media in August 2012.[5] Rode denied the allegations and has expressed willingness to submit himself to a DNA test. He also announced lawsuits against the media for alleged breaches of his right to privacy. \"After all they've done to me they deserve this,\" Slovenian media quoted Rode as saying.[6] DNA test was negative \u2013 allegations were false.[7]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"ROD\u00c9 Card.

On 2 December 1967, he was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Juan Carlos Aramburu.[2]\n[edit] Pastoral work\nHe then served as parochial vicar of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen in Villa Urquiza and secretary to Archbishop Aramburu until 1970, when he was sent to further his studies in Rome. He there attended the Pontifical Gregorian University, from where he obtained a doctorate in canon law, and the Pontifical Latin American College.[3] In 1971, he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, which trains papal diplomats.[1]\n[edit] Diplomatic work\nIn 1974, Sandri became an official of the Apostolic Nunciature in Madagascar and Mauritius, which also serves as the Apostolic Delegation in the islands of Comoros and R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean.[1]\nHe then served in the Vatican Secretariat of State, as secretary of the Substitute for General Affairs, from 1977 to 1989; and in the Apostolic Nunciature in the United States, as permanent observer of the Holy See before the Organization of American States, from 1989 to 1991.\nHe became regent of the Prefecture of the Pontifical Household on 22 August 1991, and assessor of the Section for General Affairs in the Secretariat of State on 2 April 1992.[3] On 22 July 1997, Sandri was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Venezuela and Titular Archbishop of Aemona by Pope John Paul II.\n[edit] Bishop\nHe received his episcopal consecration on the following 11 October from Cardinal Angelo Sodano, with Cardinal Aramburu and Archbishop Giovanni Battista Re serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter's Basilica.[2] He selected as his episcopal motto: \"Ille Fidelis\", meaning, \"He (Christ) remains faithful\" (2\u00a0Timothy 2:13). After two years in Venezuela, he briefly served as Apostolic Nuncio to Mexico from 1 March to 16 September 2000, when he was named Substitute for General Affairs.[2]\n[edit] Secretariat of State\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Cardinal Sandri\n\n\nAs Substitute, Sandri held the third most important position within the Vatican (after the Cardinal Secretary of State and the Pope himself), serving essentially as the chief of staff of the Secretariat of State.[4]\nDuring the time of John Paul II's declining health, he would read the texts that the Pope could not personally deliver; he later announced the Pope's death to the world from St. Peter's Square on the evening of 2 April 2005, saying, \"Our Holy Father John Paul has returned to the house of the Father...We all feel like orphans this evening.\"[5][6]\nIn April 2005 Archbishop Sandri was awarded Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.[7]\n[edit] Congregation for the Oriental Churches\nOn 9 June 2007, Sandri was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches by Pope Benedict XVI.[8] Succeeding Ignatius I Daoud, he heads the curial congregation that handles matters regarding the Eastern Catholic Churches and is the ex officio Grand Chancellor of the Pontifical Oriental Institute.\nSandri, who visited the Holy Land in February 2008,[9] has lamented the emigration of Christians from that region, saying, \"This lack of peace makes Christians emigrate and leave their land behind. So we're left with a purely geological, physical presence of Jesus, and not with the presence of those that grew with him and lived his faith, and that continue to follow him today like disciples of his very homeland.\"[10] Some have attributed the delay in the canonization process for John Paul II to Sandri's apparent reluctance to testify in the effort.[11]\n[edit] Cardinal\n\n\nStyles of\nLeonardo Sandri\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nBenedict XVI created him Cardinal-Deacon of S. Biagio e Carlo ai Catinari in the consistory of 24 November 2007.[3] He delivered the message of thanksgiving to the Pope on behalf of the new cardinals.[12]\nIn addition to his duties as Cardinal Prefect, Cardinal Sandri is a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, Pontifical Commission for Latin America and Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State.[1] On 2 March 2010 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for Bishops, and gets to assist in the appointment of Latin Rite bishops in non-missionary dioceses.[13] On 31 May 2011 he was appointed a member of the Apostolic Signatura.[14] He is eligible to participate in a papal conclave until he reaches the age of 80 on 18 November 2023.\nCardinal Sandri, in his role as Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, was named by Pope Benedict XVI be one of two co-presidents of the special Synod of Bishops for the Middle East, to be held at the Vatican in October 2010.\nHe speaks English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.[3] On 12 June 2012 Cardinal Sandri was appointed a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education.[15]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Jewish-Christian relations\nCardinal Sandri was present at Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the Yad Vashem memorial and commented that his speech was a source of joy for both Christians and Jews.[16]\n[edit] Iraqi Christians\nSandri has said that although the regime of Saddam Hussein was dictatorial, it is undeniable that Iraqi clergy and laity felt more secure under his regime and that their liturgical life went on undisturbed.[17]\n[edit] Religious illiteracy\nCardinal Sandri has praised the work of L'Osservatore Romano and the Vatican Publishing House for their work in combatting religious, biblical and ecclesial illiteracy.[18]\n[edit] Notes\n\n\n^ a b c d \"SANDRI Card.

He studied medicine for two semesters in M\u00fcnster, and philosophy at the Philosophical Faculty of Paderborn as well as in Lyon, France. After studying at the Theological Faculty of Paderborn, Cordes attended the University of Mainz, where he was also an assistant to Professor Karl Lehmann, under whom Cordes was also the first student to defend his thesis (\"Sendung zum Dienst. Exegetisch-historische und systematische Studien zum Konzilsdekret '\u00dcber Leben und Dienst der Priester'\", 1971).\n[edit] Priest\nCordes was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Lorenz J\u00e4ger on 21 December 1961. He then served as Prefect of Studienheim Sankt Klemens for late vocations of the dioceses of Paderborn and M\u00fcnster until 1966. From 1966-69, Cordes was Prefect of Collegium Leonium, the archdiocesan seminary of Paderborn. In 1972, he was called to the secretariat of the Episcopal Conference of Germany, where he served as relator for pastoral affairs.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn 27 October 1975, Cordes was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Paderborn and Titular Bishop of Naissus by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on 1 February 1976 from Archbishop Johannes Joachim Degenhardt, with Cardinal Julius D\u00f6pfner and Bishop Paul Nordhues serving as co-consecrators, in the Cathedral of Paderborn. Cordes was later named an honorary canon of the cathedral chapter on 20 July 1980.\nHe entered the service of the Roman Curia upon his appointment as Vice-President of the Pontifical Council for the Laity on 11 March 1980. On 2 December 1995, Cordes was made President of Pontifical Council Cor Unum, and he was raised to the rank of archbishop. He served as a special papal envoy to the peoples of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, when they were struck by Hurricane Mitch from 29 November to 3 December 1998.\n[edit] Cardinal\nPope Benedict XVI created him Cardinal-Deacon of S. Lorenzo in Piscibus in the consistory of 24 November 2007. Cordes will be eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves until he reaches the age of eighty in 2014.\nOn 12 June 2008, in addition to his main duties he was appointed by Benedict as a member of congregations in the Roman Curia; these are the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, the Congregation for the Clergy and the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. In November 2010 he was also appointed a member of the Congregation for Bishops. He will cease to be a member of these dicastries on his 80th birthday in 2014.\n[edit] Views\nIn an article in the Catholic Herald, Cordes argued that secularization comes from the early 17th century British idea that democracy should be handled as a religious and moral principle, in line with the Reformation idea of the priesthood of all believers. He argued that such a principle would be fatal to the Church if the laymen-centered theology of the Second Vatican Council were to be applied in a similar way. He claimed the German press tried to turn the Williamson affair into a Benedict affair.[1]\n[edit] External links\n\nCatholic-Hierarchy\nCardinals of the Holy Roman Church\nCatholic-pages bio\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nLucas Moreira Neves, OP\nVice-President of the Pontifical Council for the Laity\n1980\u20131995\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nStanis\u0142aw Ry\u0142ko\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nRoger Etchegaray\nPresident of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum\n2 December 1995\u20137 October 2010\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nRobert Sarah\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n^ A look back at the Bishop Williamson affair\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nCordes, Paul Josef\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nGerman cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n5 September 1934\n\n\nPlace of birth\nKirchhundem, Germany\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6527/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 26238/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 31819/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 12560/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:13968199-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130227231512 ", "Name": "Paul Josef Cordes"}, {"url": "/wiki/Angelo_Comastri", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Angelo Comastri\n\n\nPresident of the Fabric of St. Peter, Vicar General of His Holiness for the State of Vatican City & Archpriest of St. Peter's Basilica\n\n\n\n\n\nAppointed\n5 February 2005\n\n\nPredecessor\nFrancesco Marchisano\n\n\nOther posts\n\n\n\nCardinal-Deacon of S.

He was Archivist of the Vatican Secret Archives, Librarian of the Vatican Library, and president (Consiglio di Presidenza) of Scuola Vaticana di Paleografia, Diplomatica e Archivistica.[1] Farina was elevated to the cardinalate in 2007.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life\n2 Curial appointments\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life\nBorn in Buonalbergo, Farina entered the Congregation of St. Francis of Sales of St. John Bosco, more commonly known as the Salesians, at the Novitiate of Portici Bellavista at the age of sixteen. He professed on 25 September 1949, and made his perpetual vows on 25 September 1954; one of his sisters is also a Salesian. Farina began his studies in theology at the Pontifical Salesian Athenaeum of Turin in 1954 as well, obtaining his licentiate in theology from the Athenaeum in 1958. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Michele Alberto Arduino, S.D.B., on 1 July 1958.\nFarina later studied ecclesiastical history at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, and received his doctorate in 1965. For the following three years, he worked on his specialization at the German Foundation \"Humboldt\" in Freiburg and Bonn. From 1968 to 1972, he was Professor of History of the Church (covering the origin to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 A.D.) and of Methodology in the Theological Faculty of the Pontifical Salesian University; he then served as dean of the same faculty until 1974, and was rector of the university for two terms (1977\u20131983, 1992\u20131997). Farina was named regolatore of the XXI general chapter of his congregation in 1978.\n[edit] Curial appointments\nFrom 1982 to 1986, he was Secretary of the Pontifical Committee for Historical Sciences, and was made Undersecretary of Pontifical Council for Culture within the Roman Curia in 1986. Named Prefect of the Vatican Library by Pope John Paul II on 25 May 1997, he was the second-highest official in that office, successively under Cardinals Luigi Poggi and Jean-Louis Tauran.\nOn 15 November 2006, Farina was appointed Titular Bishop of Opitergium by Pope Benedict XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 16 December from three cardinals, fellow Salesian Tarcisio Bertone as principal consecrator, with James Stafford and Jean-Louis Tauran as co-consecrators, in St. Peter's Basilica. Farina was later named Archivist of the Vatican Secret Archives and Librarian of the Vatican Library on 25 June 2007, replacing Cardinal Tauran, who was made President of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue. On the same date he was given the rank of Archbishop.\nPope Benedict created him Cardinal-Deacon of San Giovanni della Pigna in the consistory of 24 November of that same year. Cardinal Farina will be eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves until he reaches the age of eighty on 24 September 2013.\nOn 12 June 2008 in addition to his main duties he was appointed by Benedict as a member of congregations in the Roman Curia [1]. These are: the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, Congregation for Catholic Education and the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church.\nOn 9 June 2012 he retires from posts of Archivist of the Vatican Secret Archives and Librarian of the Vatican Library.\nCardinal Farina currently sits on the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and is also fluent in German, Spanish, Japanese, and French.\nIn August 2010 Farina said that Pope John Paul II declined then-Cardinal Ratzinger's request to spend his last years as the archivist and librarian of the Holy Roman Church. Farina recalled when he was appointed prefect of the Vatican Library in May 1997 having a brief meeting with Ratzinger in which he was asked his opinion of Ratzinger joining the team. Ratzinger asked the Pope if he could step down from his role when he turned 70 on 16 April 1997. \"He was asking me what I thought of his idea and what being archivist and librarian of the Holy Roman Church involved\", said Farina.[2]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ asv.vatican.va\n^ Pope Benedict wanted to be a librarian\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nCatholic-Hierarchy\nWhispers in the Loggia\nCardinals of the Holy Roman Church\nCatholic-pages\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nGiuseppe G.

He studied philosophy and theology.\nHe was ordained a priest on 22 December 1967, becoming a member of the Salesians of Saint John Bosco. He studied at the Salesian Pontifical University gaining a licenitate in philosophy, specializing in Christology. In 1972 he began to teach at the Salesian as an assistant. In 1974 he obtained his doctorate at the Pontifical Gregorian University with a dissertation on The Tridentine pronouncements on the need for sacramental confession in canons 6\u20139, Session XIV.\nIn the years 1978 to 1979 he was a fellow of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in Thessaloniki in Greece, at the monastery Orthodox Mon\u00ed Vlat\u00e1don, home of the renowned Institute of patriarchal patristic studies. In 1988 he spent a sabbatical year in Washington, DC, USA, where he began to study the theology of religions.\n[edit] Academic life\nHe was professor of dogmatics at the Salesian Pontifical University, and for twelve years (from 1981 to 1987 and then 1993 to 1997) was dean of the Faculty of Theology.\nHe served as a consultor to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity as well as for the Congregation for Bishops.\nHis publications include: Trinit\u00e0 in contesto, Biblioteca di Scienze Religiose 110 (Roma: LAS, 1994); La Catechesi al traguardo.

He was consecrated bishop on 6 January 2003 by Pope John Paul II with archbishops Leonardo Sandri and Antonio Maria Vegli\u00f2 serving as co-consecrators.\nIn addition to his role as CDF Secretary, Amato served as a consultor to the Pontifical Councils for Christian Unity and, Interreligious Dialogue.\n[edit] Galileo Galilei treatment\nThe belief that the Catholic Church persecuted Galileo Galilei for pointing out that the Earth goes round the Sun was quite wrong, the Secretary of the Vatican's Doctrinal Congregation, Archbishop Amato claimed. Citing a letter recently discovered in the Vatican's archive, Archbishop Amato said it proved the church had treated him very well.\nThe letter, sent by the Commissioner of the Holy Office to Francesco Barberini in 1633, expressed the Pope's concern that the trial of the scientist accused of heresy be concluded quickly as his health was poor. Archbishop Amato told the Italian weekly magazine Famiglia Cristiana that the letter proved that the church's attitude to the great astronomer was benign.[2]\n[edit] Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints\n\n\n\n\nArchbishop Amato at a beatification ceremony in the Esztergom Basilica\n\n\nAfter the 2005 Papal conclave, Amato was the first person received in private audience by the new Pope Benedict XVI, who until his election had been Prefect of the Congregation of which Amato continued to be Secretary until 9 July 2008, when Pope Benedict named him Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.[3] Thus, Amato oversees the process which leads to the canonisation of saints, which includes preparing a case, including the approval of certified miracles. The case is presented to the pope, who decides whether or not to proceed with beatification or canonisation. Amato is the second CDF Secretary to lead the Causes of Saints dicastery, the first being Alberto Bovone.\n\n\nStyles of\nAngelo Cardinal Amato, SDB\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nOn 6 July 2010 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.[4] On 16 October 2010 he was appointed by Pope Benedict as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for a five year renewable term. It will be renewed until his 80th birthday.[5]. Being resident in Rome, he is invited to attend not only the plenary meetings of those departments, which in principle are held every year, but also the ordinary meetings.\nAmato was created and proclaimed Cardinal-Deacon of S. Maria in Aquiro by Pope Benedict XVI in the consistory of 20 November 2010. On 29 December 2010 Cardinal Amato was appointed member of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.[6]\nOn Friday 14 January 2011, Pope Benedict signed a decree attributing a miracle to the intercession of the Venerable Servant of God, Pope John Paul II, clearing the way for his beatification, which took place on 1 May 2011. Cardinal Amato said that the \"Papal dispensation of the 5-year waiting period before opening a cause, and the second was the placing of the cause on a 'fast track' that by-passed the waiting list. There were, however, no corners cut with regard to the rigor and accuracy of procedure. The case was treated like any other, following all the steps prescribed by the law of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. On the contrary, if I may speak further to one of my first observations: precisely in order to honor the dignity and the memory of this great Pope, to avoid any doubt and overcome any difficulties, the case was subjected to particularly careful scrutiny.\"[7]\n[edit] Future work\nIn June 2013 (at age 75), Cardinal Amato will submit his age-induced resignation to the Pope.\nAmato is considered papabile for the Papal conclave, 2013.[8]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Rinuncia del Prefetto della Congregazione delle Cause dei Santi e Nomina del Nuovo Prefetto\" (in Italian) (Press release).

Cardinal Sarah can fluently speak French, English and Italian.\nCardinal Sarah was born in 1945 in French Guinea. Initial studies in Ourous; in 1957, he entered the Seminary of Bingerville, Ivory Coast. On 2 October 1958, Guinea became independent after the referendum of 28 September. The Guinean seminarists who were studying in Bingerville, returned to the new country and entered the Seminary of Dixinn in 1960, but only for a year because on 15 August 1961, the Democratic Party of Guinea nationalised all the private Catholic schools including the Seminary of Dixinn. After staying in their respective parishes, the seminarians, including Sarah, gathered at the locals of the parish of Sainte Croix, Kindia, waiting for the opening of the Seminary Jean XXIII, situated 135 kilometers from Conakry.\nAfter obtaining a baccalaureate in 1964, young Sarah was sent to France to study at the Grand Seminary of Nancy. But because of the political relations between France and Guinea, he had to go to S\u00e9bikotane, S\u00e9n\u00e9gal, to finish his theological formation. Later that year he was sent to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome, where he obtained a licentiate in theology; and at the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum of Jerusalem, where he obtained a licentiate in Sacred Scriptures. Sarah returned to Guinea in 1974.\nSarah was ordained to the priesthood on 20 July 1969 at the age of 24. Then-Father Sarah was incardinated in the diocese of Conakry. He was appointed as the Metropolitan Archbishop of Conakry on 13 August 1979 by Pope John Paul II at the age of 34. He received his episcopal consecration on 8 December 1979 by Cardinal Giovanni Benelli. Archbishop Sarah served as the ordinary of the Archdiocese of Conakry until his appointment by Pope John Paul II as the Secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples on 1 October 2001.\nOn 1 September 2010 Archbishop Sarah criticised Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s call for Islam to become the religion of all of Europe, labelling it disrespectful to the Pope and Catholic Italy.[2] Archbishop Sarah said that \u201cTo speak of the European continent converting to Islam makes no sense because it is the people alone who decide consciously to be Christian, Muslim or to follow other religions,\u201d.\nArchbishop Sarah was appointed as the President of the Pontifical Council \"Cor Unum\" replacing Cardinal Paul Cordes whose resignation had been accepted due to age. Cardinal Cordes had served as president since 1995. Archbishop Sarah, in his new role, was charged with orgainsing Catholic relief around the world. Then-Archbishop Sarah became the second African appointed by Pope Benedict to lead a Vatican dicastary after Cardinal Peter Turkson (who had previously been the Metropolitan Archbishop of Cape Coast, Ghana) was appointed as president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace in 2009. They follow in the footsteps of three other Cardinals who had significant impacts at the Vatican: Cardinal Bernardin Gantin (who as Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals and Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops was the highest-ranking modern Catholic African), Cardinal Francis Arinze, and the first African Cardinal and close friend of Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Laurean Rugambwa.\nOn 20 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI created and proclaimed him Cardinal-Deacon of San Giovanni Bosco in via Tuscolana. He will have voting rights in papal conclaves until his 80th birthday. On 29 December 2010, Cardinal Sarah was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, Pontifical Council for the Laity and Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.[3]\n[edit] Sources\n\n\n^ RINUNCIA DEL PRESIDENTE DEL PONTIFICIO CONSIGLIO \"COR UNUM\" E NOMINA DEL SUCCESSORE\n^ Vatican slams Khadafi call for Muslim Europe\n^ NOMINA DI CARDINALI MEMBRI DEI DICASTERI DELLA CURIA ROMANA\n\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nRaymond-Maria Tchidimbo, C.S.Sp\nArchbishop of Conakry\n13 August 1979\u20131 October 2001\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nVincent Coulibaly\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nMarcello Zago, OMI\nSecretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples\n1 October 2001\u20137 October 2010\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nSavio Hon Tai-Fai, SDB\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nPaul Cordes\nPresident of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum\n7 October 2010\u2013present\nIncumbent\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nSarah, Robert\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic bishop\n\n\nDate of birth\n15 June 1945\n\n\nPlace of birth\n\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6341/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 26982/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 27624/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 10629/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:29095196-0!*!0!*!*!4!* and timestamp 20130227224143 ", "Name": "Robert Sarah"}, {"url": "/wiki/Francesco_Monterisi", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Francesco Monterisi\n\n\nCardinal-Archpriest Emeritus of the Saint Paul Outside-the-Walls Basilica\n\n\n\nFrancesco Monterisi in Sarajevo, 2012\n\n\nChurch\nBasilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls\n\n\nAppointed\n3 July 2009\n\n\nReign ended\n23 November 2012\n\n\nPredecessor\nAndrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo\n\n\nSuccessor\nJames Michael Harvey\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nOrdination\n16 March 1957\nby\u00a0Reginaldo Giuseppe Maria Addazi\n\n\nConsecration\n6 January 1983\nby\u00a0Pope John Paul II\n\n\nCreated Cardinal\n20 November 2010\n\n\nRank\nCardinal-Deacon of San Paolo alla Regola\n\n\nPersonal details\n\n\nBirth name\nFrancesco Marco Nicola Monterisi\n\n\nBorn\n(1934-05-28) 28 May 1934 (age\u00a078)\nBarletta, Italy\n\n\nNationality\nItalian\n\n\nDenomination\nRoman Catholic\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\n\nTitular Archbishop of Alba Maritima (1982\u20132010)\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Korea (1982\u20131987)\nApostolic Nuncio to Bosnia-Herzegovina (1993\u20131998)\nSecretary of the Congregation for Bishops (1998\u20132009)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlma mater\nPontifical Lateran University, Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\n\nFrancesco Marco Nicola Monterisi (born 28 May 1934) is an Italian cardinal of the Catholic Church.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and ordination\n2 Nuncio\n3 Roman Curia\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and ordination\nAfter his elementary and secondary studies in Barletta, he entered the Pontifical Minor Seminary, Rome; and then, the Pontifical Major Seminary. From 1951 to 1958, he studied at the Pontifical Lateran University, Rome, where he obtained a doctorate in theology; after finishing his studies, he returned home. He was summoned back to Rome in 1961 to study diplomacy at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy; at the same time, he studied canon law at the Pontifical Lateran University, where he earned a doctorate in canon law in 1964. Besides his native Italian, he speaks English, French, German and Spanish. Monterisi was ordained to the priesthood on 16 March 1957.\n[edit] Nuncio\nOn 24 December 1982, he was appointed Pro-Nuncio to Korea and Titular Archbishop of Alba Maritima. Monterisi received his episcopal consecration on 6 January 1983 from Pope John Paul II himself, with Archbishops Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Somalo and Duraisamy Simon Lourdusamy serving as co-consecrators.\nPope John Paul named him Nuncio to Bosnia and Herzegovina on 11 June 1993, and Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops on 7 March 1998.

From 1998 until his appointment as Archpriest he served as Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops in the Roman Curia.\nOn 3 July 2009, Pope Benedict appointed Archbishop Monterisi, just past his 75th birthday, to the post of Archpriest of the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside-the-Walls, placing him in line for elevation to the Sacred College of Cardinals as is the custom for secretaries of the Congregation for Bishops.\nOn 20 November 2010, he was created Cardinal-Deacon of San Paolo alla Regola. On 29 December 2010 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.[1] On 24 October 2012 Cardinal Monterisi was appointed a member of the Congregation for Bishops. On the same day a new consistory was announced with his designated successor as archpriest, Archbishop James Michael Harvey, among the new cardinals-designate.\nCardinal Monterisi will have voting rights in any papal conclave that takes place before 28 May 2014.\n[edit] References\n\n^ NOMINA DI CARDINALI MEMBRI DEI DICASTERI DELLA CURIA ROMANA\n\n[edit] External links\n\nCatholic-Hierarchy\nInterview on Opus Dei\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nnone\nDelegate for Pontifical Representations\n28 August 1990 \u2013 7 March 1998\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nCarlo Maria Vigan\u00f2\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nJorge Mar\u00eda Mej\u00eda\nSecretary of the Congregation for Bishops\n7 March 1998 \u2013 3 July 2009\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nManuel Monteiro de Castro\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAndrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo\nArchpriest of the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls\n3 July 2009 \u2013 23 November 2012\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nJames Michael Harvey\n\n\nDiplomatic posts\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nnone\nApostolic Nuncio to Bosnia and Herzegovina\n11 June 1993 \u2013 7 March 1998\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nGiuseppe Leanza\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nMonterisi, Francesco\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\n\n\n\nDate of birth\n28 May 1934\n\n\nPlace of birth\nBarletta, Italy\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6511/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 26482/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 32659/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 13665/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:11159868-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130227224614 ", "Name": "Francesco Monterisi"}, {"url": "/wiki/Raymond_Leo_Burke", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0\nRaymond Leo Burke\n\n\nPrefect of the Apostolic Signatura\n\n\n\n\n\nSee\nSt. Louis (emeritus)\nSant'Agata dei Goti (titular)\n\n\nAppointed\nJune 27, 2008\n\n\nPredecessor\nAgostino Vallini\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Deacon of S.

He was baptized on July 11, 1948. The family later moved to Stratford, Wisconsin. From 1962 to 1968, he attended the Holy Cross Seminary in La Crosse, Wisconsin. From 1968 to 1971, he studied at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. as a Basselin scholar and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1970 and a Master of Arts degree in 1971, both in philosophy. He completed studies for the priesthood at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome between 1971 and 1975, receiving a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree and a Master of Arts, degree.[3] Pope Paul VI ordained Burke to the priesthood on June 29, 1975 at Saint Peter's Basilica.[3]\nBurke is a member of the Board of Trustees of The Catholic University of America.\n[edit] Priestly ministry\nAfter his ordination to the priesthood Burke was assigned as assistant rector of the Cathedral of St. Joseph the Workman in La Crosse, Wisconsin. He also taught religion at Aquinas High School in La Crosse (where the Bishop Burke Hall, was named in his honor in 1997).[4] From 1980 to 1984, Burke studied canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he received his license in canon law (1982) and doctorate in canon law (1984).[3] He then returned to La Crosse and was named the Moderator of the Curia and Vice Chancellor of the La Crosse Diocese. In 1989, Pope John Paul II named Burke the first American Defender of the Bond of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the highest ecclesiastical court in the Catholic Church, apart from the Pope himself.[3]\n[edit] Episcopal ministry\n[edit] Bishop of La Crosse\nOn December 10, 1994, Pope John Paul II named Burke Bishop of La Crosse, consecrating him to the episcopate on January 6, 1995 in St. Peter's Basilica.[5] Burke took possession of the See of La Crosse on February 22, 1995.[5]\nIn 2000 Burke convened the fifth diocesan synod for the Diocese of La Crosse, which resulted in the publication of Synod V, acts\u00a0: celebrated June 11-14, 2000 in 2003.[6] He was also named a Knight Commander with Star of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 1997 and received the Canon Law Society of America's Role of Law award in 2000.[3] In 2002, Burke was influential in founding the Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem, an order of Augustinian canons dedicated to the traditional form of the liturgy.[7]\nDuring his tenure as Bishop of La Crosse, Burke initiated the construction of a shrine near La Crosse on the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe, patroness of the Americas.[8][9][10][11] As part of the shrine, a chapel designed in the Renaissance style was dedicated on July 31, 2008. The archbishop also installed a prominent shrine to the Sacred Heart in the diocesan cathedral, reflecting his desire to foster the sacred arts and to encourage spiritual devotions which have long been characteristic of Catholicism.[12] Cardinal Burke remains director of the Our Lady of Guadalupe Shrine, even though currently residing in Rome, Italy.[13]\nA few priests in the Diocese of La Crosse have claimed that Burke's leadership there was divisive. The construction of the shrine, the diocese's withdrawal from Church World Service's annual Crop Walk, and his welcoming of fringe religious orders alienated some priests and laity.[14]\n[edit] Archbishop of St. Louis\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Card. Raymond Leo Burke as Archbishop of Saint Louis\n\n\nBurke served as Bishop of La Crosse until December 2, 2003, when he was named Archbishop of St. Louis, succeeding Cardinal Justin Francis Rigali (who had been appointed to be the Archbishop of Philadelphia) as Archbishop of St. Louis.[15][16][17][18] He was installed on January 26, 2004. Burke was presented with the pallium on June 29, 2004 by Pope John Paul II. In St. Louis, Burke emphasized the promotion of vocations to the ministerial priesthood; he also published a column in the archdiocesan weekly newspaper, the Saint Louis Review. In both La Crosse and St. Louis, Burke established oratories for those who attend the Tridentine Rite. He invited traditionalist Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priests into his dioceses and ordained priests for the group both in the U.S. and abroad. His ordination of two traditionalist priests on June 15, 2007, was the first time in 40 years that the Tridentine rite of ordination had been used in the cathedral.[19] In July 2006, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Burke as a member of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura,[20] the highest court in the Catholic Church. He issued a statement, in line with Catholic moral precepts, opposing embryonic stem cell research when an amendment to the Missouri Constitution that allows it was narrowly passed by voters there.\nDuring his tenure in Saint Louis, Archbishop Burke was awarded two honorary doctorates in humane letters. One was from Ave Maria University in 2005;[21] the other was from Christendom College in 2007.[22]\nOn June 25, 2007, Burke accompanied Cardinal Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley, Archbishop of Boston, on a trip to Rome, where the prelates reviewed Pope Benedict's impending motu proprio Summorum Pontificum granting any priest of the Roman Rite to celebrate the Latin Mass according to the Missal of Pius V (revised by John XXIII) without the permission of his bishop.[23]\nOn May 6, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI named Burke to two Vatican offices, increasing Burke's already prominent stature in Rome. He was named a member of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, which authentically interprets Canon Law, and also became a member of the Congregation for the Clergy, which regulates the formation and training of diocesan priests and deacons.\n[edit] Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura\n\n\nStyles of\nRaymond Leo Burke\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nOn June 27, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Archbishop Burke to the office of Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura,[24] a position roughly equivalent to that of President of the Conseil d'Etat of France. The Signatura is the final canonical venue for most administrative recourses (requests for review of decrees issued by Bishops) unless the Pope advocates cases to his judgement, while the Tribunal of the Roman Rota remains the highest judicial venue for ecclesiastical trials, excepting questions of nullity of its decrees or sentences which are judged by Signatura. In terms of the importance of his Curial post, Archbishop Burke was the second-highest ranking American prelate at the Vatican after Cardinal William Levada, who took Pope Benedict's place as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\nArchbishop Burke was the first non-European named to head the Tribunal within the Roman Curia. The Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura exercises final appellate jurisdiction concerning conflicts occurring between two or more Vatican Congregations or Dicasteries, and appeals of administrative decisions rendered by diocesan bishops and Vatican Congregations.\nWith this appointment, Burke became the tenth US native to serve in the Roman Curia. Upon the public announcement of the appointment by the Holy See, he said: \"I am deeply humbled by the trust which His Holiness has placed in me, and, in priestly obedience, I have pledged to serve our Holy Father to the best of my abilities.\" He continued stating that \"leaving the service of the Church in the Archdiocese of Saint Louis is most sad for me. It has been an honor and gift for me to serve the archdiocese over the past four years and five months.\"[25]\nHis farewell Mass in the Archdiocese of St. Louis was held in the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis on Sunday, August 17, 2008. It was concelebrated by Bishops George Joseph Lucas, Robert Joseph Hermann, John Joseph Leibrecht, John R. Gaydos, Robert W. Finn, Raymond James Boland, and Kevin William Vann. Over seventy-five priests, fifty seminarians, a full honor guard of the Knights of Columbus (over 60 members), and over fifty Knights and Dames of the Order of Malta were in attendance.[26]\nLike all heads of departments of the Roman Curia, Cardinal Burke is a member also of various other offices in the Curia. The appointments are for five years and are renewable. Being resident in Rome, he is invited to attend not only the plenary meetings of those departments, which in principle are held every year, but also the ordinary meetings. Thus on May 6, 2008, Burke was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, which authentically interprets canon law, and of the Congregation for the Clergy, which regulates the formation and training of diocesan priests and deacons; on October 17, 2009, of the Congregation for Bishops, the curial body charged with overseeing the appointment of most but not all Latin Rite bishops outside mission territories.[27] [5]; on July 6, 2010, of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments;[28] on July 24, 2010, of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints;[29] on January 29, 2011 of the Council of Cardinals and Bishops of the Section for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State.[30]\nOn October 7, 2008, Burke was appointed President of the Commission for Advocates, which is responsible for admitting the world's qualified canon lawyers to a registry of those who may practice in the Vatican's courts \u2013 a sort of bar association. This post is related, but secondary to and distinct from his post as Prefect of the Signatura.[31]\nOn March 11, 2010 (in the wake of the sexual abuse scandal that had come to light in the countries of Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria), Burke said that the Vatican needed to design a set of guidelines based in canon law that would guide bishops and tribunals worldwide in determining how to report the cases to the Holy See. Revisions will also be made to a policy formulated by Benedict that provides for high levels of secrecy in the process. The German bishops had drawn up guidelines that Pope Benedict XVI was considering using worldwide, and many other countries (such as the United States) already have set procedures for such cases. However, it is a delicate process, especially for a bishop who must formally denounce and remove a priest (presuming he is indeed guilty and thus that the accusations are based in fact), who is spiritually considered to be his son. Also, there remain questions about how to handle scandals that only come to light during sacramental confession, where the confessor is obliged under pain of excommunication to be totally silent about anything and everything he hears from any penitent. A further problem is the fact that some pedophile priests who are perpetrators of child sexual abuse do this in the confessional, which is an especially grave offense in the eyes of the Church.[32]\n[edit] Elevation to the College of Cardinals\n\n\n\n\nRaymond Leo Cardinal Burke at a Mass at St. Clement Eucharistic Shrine in Boston, MA, USA (Dec 4, 2010)\n\n\nOn November 20, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI elevated Burke to the cardinalate, as Cardinal-Deacon of Sant'Agata dei Goti. Burke was the fifth man who served as Archbishop of St. Louis to become a member of the College of Cardinals, the others being John Joseph Glennon (1946), Joseph Ritter (1961), John Carberry (1969) and Justin Francis Rigali (2003), the now-retired Archbishop of Philadelphia.\nAccording to the St. Louis Review, the archdiocese newspaper,[33] St. Louis Archbishop Robert James Carlson announced at a reception at the Apostolic Signatura during a pilgrimage to Rome upon the occasion of Cardinal Burke's elevation the creation of a Raymond Leo Cardinal Burke Chair in Canon Law at St. Louis's Kenrick-Glennon Seminary. This follows the similar establishment of a Justin Francis Cardinal Rigali Chair in Liturgical Studies there, when former St. Louis Archbishop Justin Francis Rigali was named Archbishop of Philadelphia.\nOn February 5, 2011, the memorial of St. Agatha, Cardinal Burke took canonical possession of his titular church in Rome, Sant'Agata dei Goti. The ordinary form stational Mass, said in Italian and Latin, was held in the evening.[34]\nIn May 2011, Cardinal Burke was awarded another honorary doctorate from the Franciscan University of Steubenville in Steubenville, Ohio. In his Commencement speech, he said that long admired the University because he regards it, unlike some other American Catholic universities in the context of a highly secularized Western society, as having remained faithful to the ethical guidelines and teachings of the Church's Magisterium (the teaching office of the Catholic Church, made up of the Pope and the bishops worldwide in communion with him, and those given authority to teach by them).[35]\nIn October 2012, for the 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for the New Evangelization, he is the President of the Commission for Controversies, which is probably due to his role both as a Canon Law expert and his position as the Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura.[36]\n[edit] Notable actions and statements\nBurke is seen by many as one of the most conservative of the American bishops, and increasingly as a leader of the conservative wing of Cardinals in the Church. Reasons for his U.S. prominence include his position regarding the political actions of Catholics who hold public office, and his disputes with St. Stanislaus Kostka Church in St. Louis; while support for him among conservative Cardinals and bishops is based upon his clear and magisterial style of governance, coupled with his advancing of a return to traditional expressions of liturgical piety to the Church's fold.\n[edit] Politicians supporting legalization of abortion\nDuring the 2004 presidential election, Burke publicly stated that John Kerry and other Catholic politicians who publicly support legalized abortion should not be given or receive the Eucharist.[37] This statement was based mainly on two canons of Catholic Canon Law, which state that ministers of Holy Communion should not administer the Eucharist to people who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin[38] and that those who are conscious of being in a state of grave sin (as determined by Catholic doctrine) should not receive the Eucharist.[39]\nBurke had articulated the same position while he was in La Crosse, but the statements he made as Archbishop of St. Louis gained more notice and added to his reputation for being canonically consistent. He is one of a number of bishops who have declared that they would refuse Communion to such politicians. He added that Catholic voters who supported pro-choice candidates specifically because they supported abortion rights were committing grave sin and should not receive Communion without first having their sin absolved through the Sacrament of Penance.[citation needed]\nBurke later clarified his position, stating that one could vote for a pro-choice politician and not commit a mortal sin, if one believed there was a more significant moral issue than abortion at hand, but he also stated that he could not think of any sort of issue that would qualify.[40] His position is consistent with the one articulated by then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in a 2004 letter to Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick, of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. As Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, wrote: \u201cNot all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia [...] While the Church exhorts civil authorities to seek peace, not war, and to exercise discretion and mercy in imposing punishment on criminals, it may still be permissible to take up arms to repel an aggressor or to have recourse to capital punishment. There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia.\u201d[41]\n[edit] Sheryl Crow concert\nOn April 25, 2007, after singer Sheryl Crow, a pro-choice supporter, was scheduled to perform at a benefit concert for the Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, Archbishop Burke resigned as chair of the hospital foundation's board of directors.[42]\nDeeming this a scandal, Burke claimed that to have the hospital host Crow would give \"the impression that the Church is somehow inconsistent in its teaching.\" The Saint Louis archbishop reportedly asked that her invitation be privately removed, but then felt compelled to submit his resignation once Crow's performance in concert was confirmed.[43]\n[edit] Saint Louis University staff\nOn January 22, 2008, Burke urged Saint Louis University to take disciplinary action against its head basketball coach, Rick Majerus, after Majerus publicly supported abortion and stem cell research at a campaign event for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton three days earlier.[44]\nWith Saint Louis University being run by the Society of Jesus, Burke responded by saying, \"When you take a position in a Catholic university, you don't have to embrace everything the Catholic Church teaches. But you can't make statements which call into question the identity and mission of the Catholic Church.\" SLU spokesman Jeff Fowler responded to Burke's statement by saying, \"Rick's comments were his own personal view. They were made at an event he did not attend as a university representative.\"[45]\nBurke again responded to the controversy aroused by his statements in an interview with the archdiocesan newspaper, The St. Louis Review, on the following February 1.[46] The archbishop said, \"It gives scandal to other people, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, if they hear a Catholic give an interview to the media, saying that I am proud to be a Catholic but at the same time I hold these views.\" When asked about his usually outspoken manner in controversial issues, he responded, \"Is there something unusual about a bishop saying that it\u2019s wrong to be in favor of procured abortion? I\u2019m a Roman Catholic priest and bishop. What else would you expect me to say?\"\n[edit] Ordination of women\nIn June 2008, Burke applied an interdict, which excludes from church ministries and forbids participation in the sacraments, to Sister of Charity Louise Lears, judging her guilty of three grave canonical offenses against the Catholic Church's faith and teachings. Lears, a pastoral worker and educator, had publicly stated her belief that all of the church's ministries, including the priesthood, should be open to women.[47] Lears received the interdict after attending an attempted ordination of a woman to the Catholic priesthood at a Jewish synagogue by the WomenPriests movement.[48]\n[edit] 2008 U.S. presidential election\nIn a September 2008 interview, Burke said that \"the Democratic Party risks transforming itself definitively into a 'party of death,' because of its choices on bioethical questions,\" especially elective abortion.[49]\nIn May 2009, he stated, \"Since President Obama clearly announced, during the election campaign, his anti-life and anti-family agenda, a Catholic who knew his agenda regarding, for example, procured abortion, embryonic-stem-cell research, and same-sex marriage, could not have voted for him with a clear conscience.\"[50]\n[edit] Canon law regarding Holy Communion\nIn March 2009, Burke was interviewed by Randall Terry, the pro-life activist and Catholic convert who founded Operation Rescue. In the videotaped interview, Archbishop Burke called on American bishops to withhold Communion, in line with canon 915, from Catholic politicians who support legalized abortion.[51] The bishops' failure to do so, Burke said, \"is weakening the faith of everyone. It's giving the impression that it must be morally correct to support procured abortion.\"[51] He also called President Barack Obama \"an agent of death\" for his pro-choice views.[51] Terry called for the removal of Paul Loverde and Donald Wuerl, for not denying Communion to these politicians, and also criticized Cardinals Roger Mahony and Theodore McCarrick. After the interview was released, Burke apologized to his \"brother bishops\" for the \"misuse\" of his statements, saying: \"Mr. Terry has used the videotape for another purpose which I find most objectionable.\"[52] He clarified that he made his remarks not as Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura, head of the Vatican's highest court, but simply as an American bishop.[52]\nIn an October 2010 interview, held before the consistory in which he was elevated to the cardinalate, Burke reiterated that to directly vote for a candidate who not only supports the right to choose to have an abortion and/or to have the right to euthanasia, but who actively supports abortion and/or euthanasia, because of the candidate's stance, is a mortal sin. To vote for a candidate who held these stances without a very grave reason- and he said there were not many, if any at all- would still be wrong even if the voter did not expressly vote for him or her because of those stances. The only possible valid reason, Cardinal-designate Burke said, would be if that candidate was the least pro-abortion or pro-euthanasia of the candidates.\n[edit] Statements on Catholic higher education\nOn Wednesday, December 15, 2010, a story posted by the ZENIT website homepage (Innovative Media) described Cardinal Burke as \"underlining the importance of Catholic higher education, and the need for these institutions to keep their identity strong. The prefect...gave an address at the Thomas More College of Liberal Arts (Merrimack, New Hampshire), where he affirmed the importance that 'the Church has consistently assigned to Catholic higher education, in order that 'the convergence of faith and reason in the one truth may be seen more clearly'.\"[citation needed]\n[edit] On violations of liturgical norms\nAt the March 2, 2011 launch of a book in Italian, whose title translates as \"How to Go to Mass and Not Lose Your Faith\", Cardinal Burke declared that liturgical abuses damage the faith of Catholics: \"If we err by thinking we are the center of the liturgy, the Mass will lead to a loss of faith. Unfortunately, too many priests and bishops treat violations of liturgical norms as something that is unimportant, when, in fact, they are serious abuses.\"[53][54][55]\n[edit] On end-of-life palliative care and euthanasia\nAt a July 23, 2011 conference on end-of-life care conference sponsored by the St. Gianna Physician's Guild, Cardinal Burke said that suffering does not cause a person to have less meaning in his life, nor does it give the government the right to decide if that person should live or die: \"No matter how much a life is diminished, no matter what suffering the person is undergoing, that life demands the greatest respect and care. It's never right to snuff out a life because it's in some way under heavy burden.\"[56]\n[edit] On Catholic diocesan communications workers\nAccording to a Thursday, April 19, 2012 online news brief posted by Catholic News Service (CNS),: \"Church communicators have an important and serious duty to obey church teaching and defend the church's mission of saving souls and safeguarding truth, said the head of the Vatican's highest court. Caution as well as control over content and where it's distributed are needed because while the field of communications \"has great potential for good,\" it \"also can be turned to the harm of the faithful,\" said U.S. Cardinal Raymond L. Burke, prefect of the Supreme Court of the Apostolic Signature. Communicators should be guided and directed by pastors to make sure their content is free from doctrinal and theological error, and Catholics should avoid outlets that openly attack Christian morality, he added. The cardinal was one of dozens of speakers at a biennial seminar for people who work in the field of media and communications for dioceses, religious institutions and other church organizations. Sponsored by Rome's Pontifical University of the Holy Cross, the April 16\u201318 seminar focused on ways the church could better portray the essence and vitality of the Christian faith. Cardinal Burke, who is a canon lawyer, focused his talk April 18 on the importance of canon law in protecting the integrity of the church's mission and its members. The church's discipline and canonical processes are \"not only not a hindrance to the effective communication of the Catholic faith, but also an effective manifestation of the vitality of the faith.\"...\"[57]\n[edit] On the prospect of the successful conclusion of reintegration talks with the SSPX (the Lefebvrists)\nAccording to a Friday, June 15, 2012 posting of an online news story article by Catholic News Service (CNS), reported and written by Francis X. Rocca, Cardinal Burke, in an interview with CNS after a meeting between Bishop Bernard Fellay, the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX) and William Cardinal Levada, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, expressed confidence, that despite remaining doctrinal obstacles and problems getting all the members to reconcile with the Vatican (they will be dealt with separately and individually), that many members of the Society would most likely fully reconcile in the not too distant future.[58]\n[edit] On use of the Tridentine Mass\nIn an interview with Catholic News Service (CNS), in a video interview and an article written by Francis X. Rocca and posted on Friday, July 6, 2012, Cardinal Burke said that the Church could appreciate the unique contributions the Tridentine Mass and its style can have on possibly remedying potential errors of post-Vatican II life and liturgy of the Church, emphasizing that either Mass's liturgy had to be done properly and that the Latin Tridentine formula had to be followed correctly when it was celebrated publicly or privately. Pope Benedict XVI, in the July 2007 Apostolic Letter (formal document) Summorum Pontificum, had authorized wider use of the older Mass, in part to reconcile the SSPX and other traditionalists to the Church, but also to encourage greater awareness of the richness and depth of that liturgy.[59]\n[edit] Comments at the 2012 World Synod of Bishops On The New Evangelization\nAccording to a Thursday, October 25, 2012 news brief from Catholic News Service (CNS), in written comments to the Synod on Tuesday afternoon, October 23, Cardinal Burke criticized \"antinomianism\"- the belief that grace exempts Christians from obedience to the moral law. This abandonment of Church doctrine over the past half-century has undermined the reforms of Vatican Council II and post-conciliar ecclesial (Church) life, helping relativism and secularism, especially in the West, make what are viewed by the Church as intrinsically evil acts (those considered always, or at least nearly always wrong, usually independent of the circumstances or other factors, e.g., abortion, euthanasia, genocide, changes to marriage, embryonic stem cell research) seem less evil and more appropriate to an individual believer or to society.[60]\n[edit] Opposition for communion for Irish politicians who support abortion\nAn article in the Irish Independent on 6 February 2013 reported Cardinal Burke as stating that, in accordance with canon law, priests should exclude politicians who support abortion from receiving communion. He also stated that were the law to be changed to prevent a repetition of events like that which led to the death of Savita Halappanavar, this would be considered wrong.[61]\n[edit] Published works\n\nLack of discretion of judgment because of schizophrenia: doctrine and recent rotal jurisprudence, Doctoral Dissertation, (Rome: Pontificia Universit\u00e0 Gregoriana, 1986).

He is also the bishop emeritus of Basel having served from 1995 until he resigned the see in 2010.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Personal background\n2 Ecclesiastical career\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Personal background\nKoch was born in Emmenbr\u00fccke in the canton of Lucerne. He studied theology at the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich and at the University of Lucerne, graduating in 1975 with a Doctor of Theology. He was ordained to the priesthood on 20 June 1982.\n[edit] Ecclesiastical career\nOn 21 August 1995, Koch was elected Bishop of Basel; his election was confirmed by Pope John Paul II on the following 6 December. He received his episcopal ordination on 6 January 1997 from John Paul II himself, with Archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Jorge Mar\u00eda Mej\u00eda serving as co-consecrators.\nWhen a group of Swiss intellectuals and theologians called for John Paul's resignation on 20 May 2004, Koch described the act as \"disgusting and disloyal\" as it was, moreover, the Pope's eighty-fourth birthday.[1] In 2006, in an interview for the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung[2] he supported Muslim's freedom to build minarets in Switzerland, but also asked for greater religious freedom for Christians in Muslim countries.[3]\nOn 27 June 2007, Bishop Koch, along with several other Catholic prelates, attended a briefing from Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone at the Apostolic Palace on Pope Benedict XVI's impending motu proprio allowing wider celebration of the Tridentine Mass.[4]\nIn July 2007, Koch defended the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's document clarifying the expression of subsistit in in Lumen Gentium, while he acknowledged that the document could appear confusing or hurtful to Protestants; and he observed that the document and its reception showed the difference between the ecumenical goals of Catholics and the Orthodox on the one hand and that of Protestants on the other.[5][6]\nKoch was President of the Swiss Episcopal Conference from 2007 until 2010. He is a member of the Swiss Council of Religions.\nPope Benedict XVI announced the appointment of Koch as president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity on 1 July 2010, taking over from Cardinal Walter Kasper, who stepped down having reached the age limit.[7][8] Koch was at the same time promoted to archbishop. He recounted: \"The Holy Father told me in February, in a personal audience, his desire that I would begin to lead this council. It is a great joy for me because ecumenism has always been in my heart since in my country, Switzerland, Protestants are very close to us and I have also had a particular interest in the Orthodox Churches.\"[9]\nOn 16 October 2010, Pope Benedict appointed him as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for a five-year renewable term.[10]\nOn 20 October 2010 Pope Benedict XVI announced that he would be among the list of new cardinals to be created in a consistory on 20 November. He was duly created and proclaimed Cardinal-Deacon of Nostra Signora del Sacro Cuore on 20 November 2010. On 29 December 2010 Cardinal Koch was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches and the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue.[11]\nHe headed the Vatican's delegation to Istanbul, Turkey to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Patriarch Bartholomew I, for the Feast of Saint Andrew the Apostle on 30 November 2010 (the Patriarchate sends a delegation each year in turn for the 29 June Solemnity of the Holy Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul). He co-presided over a meeting of the International Mixed Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church in Vienna, Austria in September 2010 with Metropolitan John Zizioulas of Pergamon.\nOn 4 May 2011 Pope Benedict appointed him a member of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The five-year term will be renewed until his 80th birthday.\nCardinal Koch in his role as president of the Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews spoke to reporters 16 May, after delivering a speech on Catholic-Jewish relations in light of Vatican II's declaration \"Nostra Aetate\" on the church's relations with non-Christian religions. The speech followed Cardinal Koch's participation in a meeting of the doctrinal congregation to examine the latest progress in the Vatican's reconciliation talks with the traditionalist Society of Saint Pius X. \"There are questions to clarify in discussions with this community. I can't say more than that,\" he told reporters, echoing a Vatican statement saying the reconciliation talks are ongoing. Cardinal Koch noted that \"All the doctrinal decisions of the church are binding on a Catholic, including the Second Vatican Council and all its texts,\" Cardinal Koch said, when asked if the SSPX would be expected to accept all the teachings of Vatican II. \"The 'Nostra Aetate' declaration of the Second Vatican Council is a clear decree and is important for every Catholic,\" he added.[12]\nOn 30 October 2012, Cardinal Koch stated in an interview that, if Lutherans express a wish for an arrangement similar to the personal ordinariates for former Anglicans, the Catholic Church will have to reflect on it, but that the initiative must come from Lutherans.[13][14]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Swiss bishops denounce calls for Pope to retire\".

He is the current patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.[1]\nSardi was born in Ricaldone, province of Alessandria. Sardi was ordained a priest on 29 June 1958, after a licentiate in theology he graduated in canon law and jurisprudence at the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica Milano. He taught moral theology in Turin until 1976, when he was called to the Vatican to work in the Secretariat of State. In 1992 he was appointed Vice Councillor for General Affairs and on 10 December 1996, Apostolic Nuncio with special responsibilities and Titular Archbishop of Sutrium by Pope John Paul II. Archbishop Sardi co-ordinateds the Vatican office which edits the Pope's texts and addresses. On 6 January 1997, Pope John Paul ordained him an archbishop in Saint Peter's Basilica.\nOn 23 October 2004 he was appointed Vice Camerlengo (chamberlain) of the Holy Roman Church. He was appointed to succeed Pio Laghi, who died in January 2009 as pro-patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Archbishop Sardi has the task of promoting the spiritual interests of the Order and its members, and its relations with the Holy See.\nOn 20 November 2010, he was created and proclaimed Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria Ausiliatrice in Via Tuscolana. He will retain voting rights in any papal conclave until 1 September 2014, his 80th birthday. On 30 November 2010 Cardinal Sardi was formally appointed as full patron of the Order of Malta after being elevated to the cardinalate.[2]\nOn 29 December 2010 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and for Societies of Apostolic Life, Saints, and the Pontifical Council for the Laity.\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nPio Laghi\nPatron of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Malta\n30 November 2010\u2013incumbent\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ ARCHBISHOP PAOLO SARDI PRO-PATRON OF THE ORDER OF MALTA\n^ NOMINA DEL PATRONO DEL SOVRANO MILITARE ORDINE DI MALTA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 90241833\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nSardi, Paolo\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nItalin cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n1 September 1934\n\n\nPlace of birth\nRicaldone, Italy\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6880/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 40396/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 38317/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 13692/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 3/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:29278698-0!*!0!*!*!4!* and timestamp 20130227224630 ", "Name": "Paolo Sardi"}, {"url": "/wiki/Mauro_Piacenza", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Mauro Piacenza\u00a0J.C.D.\n\n\nPrefect of the Congregation for the Clergy\n\n\nAppointed\n7 October 2010\n\n\nPredecessor\nCl\u00e1udio Hummes, OFM\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Deacon of S.

After studying at the Major Archiepiscopal Seminary of Genoa, he was ordained to the priesthood by Giuseppe Siri on 21 December 1969. He then completed his studies in Rome, attending the Pontifical Lateran University, where he obtained a doctorate, summa cum laude, in canon law.\nAfter serving as a parochial vicar, he worked as chaplain to the University of Genoa. Piacenza taught canon law at the Theological Faculty of Northern Italy, and held several other curial posts, serving as the archbishop's press officer. He was the diocesan assistant of the ecclesial Movement of Cultural Commitment. He served as professor of contemporary culture and history of atheism at the Ligurian Higher Institute of Religious Studies as well as professor of dogmatic theology at the Diocesan Institute of Theology for the Lay \"Didascaleion\". He also taught theology at several state lyceums. He was made a canon of the Genoa Cathedral in 1986. Entering the staff of the Congregation for the Clergy in 1990, he was named its Undersecretary on 11 March 2000.\nOn 13 October 2003, Pope John Paul II appointed Piacenza President of the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church and Titular Bishop of Victoriana. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 15 November from Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, SDB, with Cardinal Dar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos and Bishop Alberto Tanasini serving as co-consecrators.\nHe was later named President of the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archeology on 28 August 2004, and then Secretary of the Congregation for the Clergy and raised to the rank of archbishop (with the same titular see) on 7 May 2007. He was appointed as Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy on 7 October 2010 replacing Cardinal Hummes. His appointment is unusual as few officials who serve as Secretary are appointed as Prefect of the same dicastery.\nIn an interview shortly after his appointment as Prefect, Archbishop Piacenza said: \"Priestly identity cannot but be Christocentric and hence Eucharistic. Christocentric because, as the Holy Father has often reminded, in the ministerial priesthood 'Christ attracts us to himself', involving himself with us and involving us in His very existence. This 'real' attraction happens sacramentally, hence in an objective and unsurpassable way, in the Eucharist, of which the priests are ministers, that is, servants and effective instruments\".[2]\nOn 20 November 2010 Pope Benedict XVI created him Cardinal-Deacon of San Paolo alle Tre Fontane and, on 29 December 2010, appointed him a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Congregation for Catholic Education, and the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.\nIn March 2011 in a letter to priests for Lent Cardinal Piacenza said \u201cAt times the fatigue is truly great\u201d and priests \u201cfeel as if we are too few to fulfil the Churches\u2019 needs\u201d, but \u201cif first we don\u2019t convert ourselves, we will become even fewer\u201d. \u201cA de-Christianized world requires a new evangelization\u201d but this in turn requires \u201cnew priests\u201d not in the superficial sense, rather priests who are profoundly \u201crenewed\u201d by the love of Christ at every Holy Mass. Cardinal Piacenza concludes, noting that \u201conly a renewed, converted priest can become an instrument through which the Spirit calls new priests\u201d.[3]\n[edit] External links\n\nCatholic-Hierarchy\n\"Stones, Sounds, Colours of the House of God\"\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ RINUNCIA DEL PREFETTO DELLA CONGREGAZIONE PER IL CLERO E NOMINA DEL SUCCESSORE\n^ Archbishop Piacenza: Formation for Priests Is a Key Priority\n^ New evangelisation needs renewed priests, says Cardinal Prefect\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nJos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s S\u00e1nchez\nPresident of the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church\n13 October 2003\u20137 May 2007\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nGianfranco Ravasi\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nCsaba Terny\u00e1k\nSecretary of the Congregation for the Clergy\n7 May 2007\u20137 October 2010\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nCelso Morga Iruzubieta\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nClaudio Hummes\nPrefect of the Congregation for the Clergy\n7 October 2010\u2013incumbent\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nClaudio Hummes\nPresident for the International Council for Catechesis\n7 October 2010\u2013incumbent\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nPiacenza, Mauro\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n15 September 1944\n\n\nPlace of birth\nGenova, Italy\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6672/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 26767/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 32602/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 14274/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:11106106-0!*!0!!*!4!* and timestamp 20130227225544 ", "Name": "Mauro Piacenza"}, {"url": "/wiki/Velasio_de_Paolis", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Velasio de Paolis,\u00a0CS JCD STL\n\n\nPresident Emeritus of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See\n\n\nAppointed\n12 April 2008\n\n\nReign ended\n21 September 2011\n\n\nPredecessor\nSergio Sebastiani\n\n\nSuccessor\nGiuseppe Versaldi\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Deacon of Ges\u00f9 Buon Pastore alla Montagnola\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nOrdination\n18 March 1961\n\n\nConsecration\n21 February 2004\nby\u00a0Angelo Sodano\n\n\nCreated Cardinal\n20 November 2010\n\n\nRank\nCardinal-Deacon\n\n\nPersonal details\n\n\nBirth name\nVelasio de Paolis\n\n\nBorn\n(1935-09-19) 19 September 1935 (age\u00a077)\nSonnino, Italy\n\n\nNationality\nItalian\n\n\nDenomination\nRoman Catholic\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\n\nTitular Bishop of Th\u00e9lepte (2003\u20132010)\nSecretary of the Apostolic Signatura (2003\u20132008)\n\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\n\n\n\nStyles of\nVelasio de Paolis\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nnone\n\n\nVelasio de Paolis, CS JCD STL (born 19 September 1935) is an Italian cardinal of the Catholic Church.

He was ordained to the priesthood on 18 March 1961, and taught canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.[3]\nSince 1971 he served as professor of canon law in the faculty of canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1980 as professor and since 1983. Since 1987 he is Professor at the Faculty of Canon Law at the Pontifical Urban University, where, after becoming a professor, dean since 1998 has the same option.\n[edit] Curial service\nOn 30 December 2003, De Paolis was appointed Secretary of the Apostolic Signatura and Titular Bishop of Thelepte [2] by Pope John Paul II.[2] He received his episcopal consecration on 21 February 2004 from Cardinal Angelo Sodano, with Archbishop Silvano Maria Tomasi, CS, and Bishop Francesco Saverio Salerno serving as co-consecrators.[2] In response to the murder of two priests in Turkey and Nigeria, he declared, \"Enough now with this turning the other cheek! It's our duty to protect ourselves...The West has had relations with the Arab countries for half a century, mostly for oil, and has not been able to get the slightest concession on human rights.\"[4]\nDe Paolis was later named President of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See by Pope Benedict XVI on 12 April 2008, also being promoted to Titular Archbishop of Thelepte.[2] As President, he essentially serves as the chief auditor for the Vatican.\nRefusing to allow the film adaption of Dan Brown's novel Angels & Demons to be filmed at churches in Rome, De Paolis said that Brown had \"turned the gospels upside down to poison the faith...It would be unacceptable to transform churches into film sets so that his blasphemous novels can be made into films in the name of business.\"[5] He also added that Brown's work \"wounds common religious feelings.\"[5]\nOn 25 January 2010 he was appointed as a member of the Apostolic Signatura, the Church's highest court, in addition to his duties at the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See.[6] On 29 December 2010 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, and the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts. He will hold these memberships until his 80th birthday.\nHe was created Cardinal-Deacon with the title of Ges\u00f9 Buon Pastore alla Montagnola by Pope Benedict XVI in the consistory of 20 November 2010. On 4 May 2011 Pope Benedict appointed him a member of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The five year term will be renewed until his 80th birthday.\nCardinal de Paolis' resignation from his position as president of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs was accepted on 21 September 2011, for the reasons of his age. He was succeeded by archbishop Giuseppe Versaldi, until then bishop of Alessandria.\n[edit] Pontifical Delegate for the Legionaries of Christ\nOn 9 July 2010, Pope Benedict appointed Archbishop de Paolis as Pontifical Delegate for the Congregation of the Legionaries of Christ,[1] after the alleged abuses by its founder were public and admitted by the congregation.\nIn October of the same year, De Paolis suggested that the Legion should redefine its mission and its governing structure. He acknowledged that questions remained about how much other Legion leaders knew about Father Maciel's abuses and that finding the truth is \"not that simple\". Plans for a renewal process could take three years or more. He and four advisers would work with Legion officials to revise the congregation\u2019s constitution, and consideration was being given to appointing a committee to address complaints made against the Legion and another to address financial management issues in the congregation. The process would include an investigation, headed by Archbishop Ricardo Blazquez of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Valladolid in Valladolid, Spain, of the lay branch of the congregation, known as Regnum Christi.[7]\nOn 20 October 2011 Cardinal De Paolis disclosed, in a letter,[8] that an investigation of Regnum Christi uncovered a series of concerns, which would require rewriting the group\u2019s norms. Vatican officials expressed concern that the consecrated members of Regnum Christi were overly subject to the Legion and called for their own structure of authority while keeping close ties to the Legion. Cardinal De Paolis said that \u201cthe issues regarding personal and community life that have emerged from this same visitation on an institutional level initially appear to be many and challenging.\u201d He indicated, however, that Regnum Christi would continue its affiliation with the Legion of Christ,[9] but that the lay group would be split from the Legion itself.\nIn a November 21, 2011 letter, Cardinal De Paolis asked the consecrated in Regnum Christi to edit their core set of norms, and took force away from a more extensive set of norms. The core set of norms (128 in number) were approved by the Vatican in 2004, not the more extensive ones (over 1,000 in number). He said a small commission would be formed soon to extract from the more extensive rules only those that are strictly necessary for their life and governance.[10]\n[edit] Handling\nOn 26 October 2011 it was reported that disillusioned members are leaving the order as they lose faith that the Vatican will push through the necessary changes. Cardinal de Paolis said in an interview that Pope Benedict tasked him only with guiding the Legion and helping rewrite its norms \u2014 not \"decapitating\" its leadership or avenging wrongdoing. Cardinal de Paolis ruled out any further investigation into the crimes of Marciel Maciel. He added that \"I don't see what good would be served\" by further inquiry into a coverup,\"Rather, we would run the risk of finding ourselves in an intrigue with no end. Because these are things that are too private for me to go investigating.\" Reports estimate 70 of the 890 Legion priests and upwards of a third of the movement's 900 consecrated women have left or are taking time away to ponder their future. De Paolis defended his commitment and approach to the reform, saying said he had \"inserted\" himself into the Legion's administration, expanded the Legion's governing council and shuffled some superiors around. He said he hasn't dismissed any superiors outright because he needs them to learn the complex details of the order's structure, culture and finances. He said his priority was to persuade the Legion's leaders to sow change from within.[11]\n[edit] Vatileaks scandal\nIn October 2012 Cardinal de Paolis told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that there was precedent for the Pope to pardon Paolo Gabriele, who has been found guilty of stealing confidential papal documents and leaking them to the media. Asked whether Gabriele would be jailed or pardoned, Cardianl de Paolis he said it only the Pope could decide. But he added: \"I feel I can say that, with a full confession of honest remorse and the absolute certainty that the crime cannot be committed again, popes have always issued, in favour of the condemned, measures dictated by the mercy that is the essence of the Church, which is always close to her children, even those found guilty.\"[12]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b \"Nomina del Delegato Pontificio per la Congregazione dei Legionari di Cristo\".

He currently serves in the Roman Curia as President of the Pontifical Council for Culture. On 20 November 2010 Ravasi was created cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early life\n1.2 Ordination\n1.3 Professor\n1.4 Candidate for bishop\n1.5 Roman Curia\n\n1.5.1 Court of the Gentiles\n1.5.2 Preaching\n\n\n1.6 Views on evolution\n1.7 Other\n\n1.7.1 2012 Earthquake\n\n\n\n\n2 References\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Biography\n[edit] Early life\nThe eldest of three children, Ravasi was born in Merate, Province of Lecco. His father was an anti-fascist tax official who served in Sicily during World War II, but later deserted the army; it took him 18 months to return to his family.[1] Ravasi would later say, \"My search has always been for something permanent, for what is behind the transitory, the contingent. I'm fighting loss and death, which probably relates to the absence of my father in my first years.\"[1] His mother was a schoolteacher.\n[edit] Ordination\nRavasi decided to join the priesthood instead of teaching Greek and Latin classics, as had been his original desire.[1] He attended the seminary of Milan, and was ordained by Cardinal Giovanni Colombo on 28 June 1966.[2] He then furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Pontifical Biblical Institute. He spent summers in Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey, working as an archaeologist with such figures as Kathleen Kenyon and Roland de Vaux.[1]\n[edit] Professor\nHe later served as a professor of exegesis of the Old Testament at the Theological Faculty of Northern Italy in Milan. From 1989 to 2007, he was prefect of the Ambrosian Library. He also collaborated with Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, S.J., but was sometimes seen as more conservative than the Cardinal on matters of faith and morals.[3]\n[edit] Candidate for bishop\nIn 2005, according to Sandro Magister, Ravasi was a leading candidate to become Bishop of Assisi but the Congregation for Bishops withdrew his candidacy after Ravasi wrote an article about Easter in the newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore, in which his statement, \"He was not raised; he arose,\" was seen as potentially heterodox.[4] Yet in 2007, at the invitation of Pope Benedict XVI, he composed the Good Friday meditations for the public procession of Stations of the Cross led by the Pope at the Colosseum.[4][5]\n[edit] Roman Curia\nOn 3 September 2007, Ravasi was appointed President of the Pontifical Council for Culture and Titular Archbishop of Villamagna in Proconsulari. He was also named President of the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church and of the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archeology. He received his episcopal consecration as an archbishop on the following 29 September from Benedict XVI himself, with Cardinals Tarcisio Bertone, S.D.B., and Marian Jaworski serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter's Basilica. On 20 November 2010, he was created and proclaimed Cardinal-Deacon of San Giorgio in Velabro.\n\n\nStyles of\nGianfranco Ravasi\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nOn 11 December 2010, Ravasi was named a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education for a five-year renewable term.[6] On 29 December 2010, he was appointed the first member of the new Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation and also a member of the Pontifical Council for Interreligous Dialogue.[7]\n[edit] Court of the Gentiles\nIn February 2011 Cardinal Ravasi said that the dialogue between believers and nonbelievers should not limit itself to finding a least common denominator of agreement, but rather should seek to confront the fundamental questions of life. Cardinal Ravasi spoke of the need for more profound dialogue with nonbelievers which took place in an interview, which took place ahead of the presentation at the University of Bologna of the \"Court of the Gentiles.\" The new Vatican structure \u2013 overseen by the culture council \u2013 was created to foster dialogue between believers and nonbelievers. The idea for this initiative was proposed in a 21 December 2009, address by Pope Benedict to the Roman Curia, in which he spoke about the \"Court of the Gentiles,\" a space in the ancient Temple of Jerusalem that was not reserved for the Jews, but rather was open to any person independent of his culture or religion. Cardinal Ravasi, \"wanted to reintroduce the ancient tradition of the 'disputed questions' \u2013 as they were called then \u2013 while at that time they had to do with different opinions and theses, in this case they will be between believers and nonbelievers.\" He added \"I am trying to see to it that this danger is avoided,\". He stated that \"I want really fundamental questions to be asked \u2013 questions of anthropology, then good and evil, life and afterlife, love suffering, the meaning of evil \u2013 questions that are substantially at the basis of human existence.\"[8]\nThe programme visited Stockholm, Sweden from 13\u201314 September 2012. It will put Cardinal Ravasi and other Catholic thinkers into dialogue with a cross-section of Sweden\u2019s leading intellectual lights on these questions: \u201cCan one choose a \u2018World without God?\u2019 How far can the human person go in the field of creation? Are there limits, and if so, what are they?\u201d[9]\n[edit] Preaching\nIn November 2011 Cardinal Ravasi said preaching in churches had become formulaic and boring that it risked becoming \"irrelevant\". He said that \"The advent of televised and computerised information requires us to be compelling and trenchant, to cut to the heart of the matter, resort to narratives and colour,\" He added that \"We need to remember that communicating faith doesn't just take place through sermons. It can be achieved through the 140 characters of a Twitter message.\"[10]\nIn February 2013 he preached the Lenten retreat Spiritual Exercises\"Ars Orandi, Ars Credendi\" to the Papal household during the final days of the pontificate of Benedict XVI\n[edit] Views on evolution\nIn 2008, he said, \"I want to affirm, as an a priori, the compatibility of the theory of evolution with the message of the Bible and the Church's theology.\"[11] He also noted that neither Charles Darwin nor his work On the Origin of Species had ever been condemned by the Church.[11]\n[edit] Other\nSome commentators thought that Ravasi would be the next Archbishop of Milan, replacing Dionigi Tettamanzi, but Angelo Scola was instead appointed to that see. However, the same writers would consider him papabile in either position.[12] Cardinal Ravasi was admitted to the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George by Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria in 2006 and promoted to Bailiff Grand Cross of Justice following his elevation to the College of Cardinals, in 2010.\n[edit] 2012 Earthquake\n\n\n\n\nSerene faces preserved on the Madonnina of Pieve di Cento\n\n\nCardinal Ravasi visited the severly-damaged Emilia Romagna region a month after the May 2012 earthquake which killed more than twenty persons and left thousands more homeless. He drew attention to the significant damage inflicted on the cultural patrimony of the region, including many historical churches by tweeting[13] a striking image of the Madonnina of Pieve di Cento.\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c d O'Grady, Desmond (16 May 2008). \"The Vatican's culture maven\".

Cardinal Filoni is an expert in Chinese affairs and on the Middle East.[1]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Education and early diplomatic work\n2 Apostolic Nuncio\n3 Roman Curia\n4 References\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Education and early diplomatic work\nHe was born near Taranto, Italy. He entered the seminary and earned doctorates in Philosophy and in Canon Law from the Pontifical Lateran University where then-Father Tarcisio Bertone, S.D.B., later the Vatican Secretary of State, served as a Guest Professor in 1978. He was ordained as a Priest on 3 July 1970. He served in the Nunciatures of Sri Lanka from 1982 until 1983, Iran from 1983\u20131985, Brasil from 1989\u20131992 and finally the Philippines from 1992 until 2001. Although formally assigned to the Apostolic Nunciature to the Philippines he was based in Hong Kong. During these years he spent his most intense and important period of work, on the Holy See\u2019s so-called \u201cStudy Mission\u201d, linked to the Manila Nunciature. During this time Archbishop Filoni was Blessed Pope John Paul II\u2019s bridge, reaching out to China\u2019s bishops, official and non-official Churches and bishops, reconciling the vast majority to the Holy See.\n[edit] Apostolic Nuncio\nPope John Paul II appointed Father Filoni as the Apostolic Nuncio to Iraq and Jordan on 17 January 2001, becoming Titular Archbishop of Volturnum. He received Episcopal Ordination from Pope John Paul on 19 March 2001.\nArchbishop Filoni defended the freedom of the Catholic Church in Iraq under the regime of Saddam Hussein and \u2013 in line with the Pope\u2019s position \u2013 opposed the US invasion of the country. He remained in Baghdad as American bombs fell, the only ambassador to do so, refusing to leave the capital, to which he says that \"It was nothing exceptional\". After the fall of Saddam he did not fail to notice some new aspects of peoples new found freedom. Yet he also warned against the lack of security and the slow development of the economy, while supporting the new constitution and supporting the peaceful coexistence between Christians and Muslims.\nHe came close to being killed in Baghdad on 1 February 2006, when a car bomb exploded next to the nunciature. \"Thank God we survived\" he stated afterward. He served in Iraq and Jordan until 25 February 2006 when he returned to the Philippines as the Nuncio.\n[edit] Roman Curia\nPope Benedict appointed Archbishop Filoni Substitute for General Affairs on 9 June 2007, formally taking office on 1 July.\nIt was Filoni's job to organise the activities of the Curia and the care of official translations of papal documents and correspondence; encryption dispatches messengers to be sent to the Registry of the papal letters, the resolution of legal issues, personnel management in the Curia and nunciatures (promotions and advances), the protocol and etiquette for visiting heads of state, information and media management Vatican archive management to shipping the blessings of the Pope. He is also responsible for organizing the activities of nuncios around the world in their activities concerning the local churches. As well as speaking his native Italian he also speaks English, Spanish, French and Portuguese.\nCommenting on his appointment he said: \u201cIt is an act of paternal benevolence on the part of the Pontiff, to which I respond without the slightest trepidation, but with the same willingness and profound gratitude I have had in the past. The wonderful words of Our Lord aid me at this time, those found in Luke (17, 10), on the attitude of those called into the Christ\u2019s service: \u2018When you have done all you have been commanded, say, 'We are unprofitable servants; we have done what we were obliged to do'.\u201d.\nIn 2008 Archbishop Filoni was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.[2]\nOn 10 May 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Filoni Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples in succession to Cardinal Ivan Dias, who had reached retirement age and had worsening diabetes. The Prefect oversees the Catholic mission territories and is traditionally dubbed the \"Red Pope\" as a reflection of both the power of his congregation and the red vestments of the Cardinal Prefect. The office's sizable resources (furnished by income from its long-maintained Roman real-estate holdings) provide a significant amount of funding to the efforts of the developing church, and the congregation's cardinals are responsible for recommending appointees to the episcopacy in mission areas, mainly African and Asian countries, a task that falls to the Congregation for Bishops in more established locales. Archbishop Savio Hon Tai-Fai is Secretary (Filoni's deputy) of the Congregation. Their knowledge of China and the government-controlled Chinese church will be crucial in resolving the long standing issue between the two entities.\nIt was announced on 6 January that he would be created a cardinal on 18 February.

In February 1969, he became advocate in the Sacred Roman Rota.\n[edit] Career in Church diplomacy\nHe entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1967. He was created Chaplain of His Holiness on 1 July 1968.

He was upgraded to Prelate of honour of His Holiness in 1 July 1981. He returned to Rome where he worked in the Second Section of the Secretariat of State from June to November 1981. The decision was taken to appoint him counselor of the nunciature in Belgium in 1981 where he served until 1985.\nIn 1985 he was appointed archbishop and pro-nuncio to the countries in the West Indies that have diplomatic relations with the Holy See, including The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Saint Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago, and apostolic delegate for the other territories, such as the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Netherlands Antilles. And at the same time was appointed archbishop. He was consecrated by Cardinal Secretary of State Agostino Casaroli. Two years later, when Antigua and Barbuda had established diplomatic relations with the Holy See, he became pro-nuncio there too instead of apostolic delegate. In 1998 he was transferred to South Africa, with responsibility also for some neighbouring countries. And in 2000 he became Apostolic Nuncio to Spain and Andorra. As such, he met with Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, to reduce the tension between the Spanish Government and the Church.\n[edit] Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops\nOn 3 July 2009, Pope Benedict appointed him secretary of the Congregation for Bishops,[2] replacing Archbishop Francesco Monterisi who was the same day appointed as archpriest of the Papal Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls.

It is he job as major penitentiary to ensure the absolution of excommunications lat\u00e6 sententi\u00e6 reserved to the Holy See, the dispensation of sacramental impediments reserved to the Holy See, and the issuance and governance of indulgences.\nIt was announced on 6 January 2012 that Archbishop Monteiro de Castro would be created a cardinal on 18 February by Pope Benedict XVI. He was duly created Cardinal-Deacon of San Domenico di Guzman on that day. On 21 April 2012 Cardinal Monteiro de Castro was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants, Congregation for the Causes of Saints and the Congregation for Bishops. He will hold these memberships until he is 80.[4]\nHe will have rights to vote in a papal conclave until his 80th birthday in 2018.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Homosexual relationships\nMonsignor Monteiro de Castro has been cited in the press for his views on homosexual relationships. He told a conference of Spanish bishops that \"there are other forms of cohabitation and it is good that they be recognised\". He insisted that same-sex unions could not be regarded as marriages, but he implied that they were at least worthy of compassion.[5]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ RINUNCIA DEL PENITENZIERE MAGGIORE E NOMINA DEL SUCCESSORE\n^ NOMINA DEL SEGRETARIO DELLA CONGREGAZIONE PER I VESCOVI\n^ Press Office of the Holy See 21.10.09\n^ [1]\n^ Papal envoy breaks ranks on gay couples\n\n\n\n\n\nDiplomatic posts\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nPaul Fouad Na\u00efm Tabet\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Bahamas, Antilles\n16 February 1985 \u2013 21 August 1990\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nEugenio Sbarbaro\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nPaul Fouad Na\u00efm Tabet\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Barbados, Antilles\n16 February 1985 \u2013 21 August 1990\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nEugenio Sbarbaro\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nPaul Fouad Na\u00efm Tabet\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Belize, Antilles\n16 February 1985 \u2013 21 August 1990\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nGiacinto Berloco\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nnone\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Dominica, Antilles\n16 February 1985 \u2013 21 August 1990\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nEugenio Sbarbaro\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nnone\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Grenada, Antilles\n16 February 1985 \u2013 21 August 1990\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nEugenio Sbarbaro\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nPaul Fouad Na\u00efm Tabet\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Jamaica, Antilles\n16 February 1985 \u2013 21 August 1990\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nEugenio Sbarbaro\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nnone\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Saint Lucia, Antilles\n16 February 1985 \u2013 21 August 1990\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nEugenio Sbarbaro\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nPaul Fouad Na\u00efm Tabet\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Trinidad and Tobago, Antilles\n16 February 1985 \u2013 21 August 1990\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nEugenio Sbarbaro\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nnone\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Antigua and Barbuda, Antilles\n25 April 1987 \u2013 21 August 1990\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nEugenio Sbarbaro\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nFrancesco De Nittis\nApostolic Nuncio to El Salvador\n21 August 1990 \u2013 2 February 1998\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nGiacinto Berloco\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nFrancesco De Nittis\nApostolic Nuncio to Honduras\n21 August 1990 \u2013 12 April 1991\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nLuigi Conti\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAmbrose Battista De Paoli\nApostolic Nuncio to South Africa\n2 February 1998 \u2013 1 March 2000\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nBlasco Francisco Colla\u00e7o\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAmbrose Battista De Paoli\nApostolic Nuncio to Namibia\n2 February 1998 \u2013 1 March 2000\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nBlasco Francisco Colla\u00e7o\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAmbrose Battista De Paoli\nApostolic Nuncio to Swaziland\n2 February 1998 \u2013 1 March 2000\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nBlasco Francisco Colla\u00e7o\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAmbrose Battista De Paoli\nApostolic Nuncio to Lesotho\n2 February 1998 \u2013 1 March 2000\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nBlasco Francisco Colla\u00e7o\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nLajos Kada\nApostolic Nuncio to Spain\n1 March 2000 \u2013 3 July 2009\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nRenzo Fratini\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nLajos Kada\nApostolic Nuncio to Andorra\n1 March 2000 \u2013 3 July 2009\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nRenzo Fratini\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nFrancesco Monterisi\nSecretary of the Congregation for Bishops\n3 July 2009 \u2013 5 January 2012\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nLorenzo Baldisseri\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nFortunato Baldelli\nMajor Penitentiary of the Apostolic Penitentiary\n5 January 2012\u2013incumbent\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nMonteiro De Castro, Manuel\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nsecretary of the Congregation for Bishops\n\n\nDate of birth\n29 March 1938\n\n\nPlace of birth\nS.

He has four brothers and three sisters \u2013 the youngest sister has Down\u2019s syndrome. After attending his philosophical studies at the Major Seminary \"Rainha dos Apostolos\" in Curitiba and the Faculty of Palmas, has completed his theological studies in Rome at the Pontifical Gregorian University, obtaining a license, and at the Pontifical Lateran University, where he graduated in 1992 in dogmatic theology.\n[edit] Career\nBraz de Aviz was ordained priest 26 November 1972 and the diocese of Apucarana, played his ministry as a parish priest in several parishes, as Rector of the Major Seminary Apucarana and Londrina, and as professor of dogmatic theology at the Theological Institute Paul VI in Londrina. He was also member of the Council of Priests and the College of Consultors and General Coordinator of the Diocesan Pastoral Apucarana. As a young priest Braz de Aviz was once on his way to a village to say Mass when he stumbled upon an armored car robbery. He was shot during the crossfire, with bullets perforating his lungs and intestines and one eye. Although he survived and surgeons were able to save his eye, he still carries fragments of those bullets in his body.[2]\nOn 6 April 1994, he was appointed to the titular bishop of Flenucleta as auxiliary of the Archdiocese of Vit\u00f3ria, and received episcopal ordination on 31 May of that year. He was transferred as ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ponta Grossa on 12 August 1998 by Pope John Paul II. He was promoted to archbishop of Maring\u00e1 on 17 July 2002 where he served until he was appointed archbishop of Bras\u00edlia on 28 January 2004. In May 2010 he organised the XVI National Eucharistic Congress, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the city.\nOn 4 January 2011, Archbishop Braz de Aviz, who is not a member of a religious order, was appointed to his current post. Since 1973, prelates ordained for religious orders and for dioceses have alternated in holding the post of prefect of the congregation overseeing religious in the Catholic Church. In the past 100 years, 11 of the 18 prefects did not belong to a religious order.\nArchbishop Braz de Aviz becomes the fourth Brazilian to head a Vatican department, after Cardinal Agnelo Rossi, who led the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples from 1970 to 1984, Cardinal Lucas Moreira Neves, who headed the Congregation for Bishops from 1998 to 2000; and Cardinal Cl\u00e1udio Hummes, who was once the Archbishop of S\u00e3o Paulo and who headed the Congregation for Clergy from 2006 to 2010.[3]\nIn February 2011, Archbishop Braz de Aviz said he almost abandoned the seminary and the Catholic Church because of the ideological excesses that emerged in the early years of liberation theology. He said in an interview with the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano that \"Personally, I lived with a lot of anguish during the years of the birth of liberation theology,\" Archbishop Braz de Aviz said he appreciated that liberation theology promoted the preferential option for the poor, which represents \"the church's sincere and responsible concern for the vast phenomenon of social exclusion.\" He said consecrated men and women need to explore more deeply the mystery of God to strengthen their relationships with others.[4]\nIn July 2011, he referred to a breakdown in trust between the Vatican and many religious orders because of \"some positions taken previously.\" The reference is to his predecessor, Slovenian Franc Rode, who repeatedly decried a \u201ccrisis\u201d in religious life following the Second Vatican Council (1962\u201365), related in part to what Rode regarded as excessively liberalizing currents in some communities. Without denying that there are problems, Braz said, his main aim is to \u201crebuild trust\u201d by approaching issues in a new way \u2013 \u201cwithout preemptive condemnations,\u201d he said, \u201cand by listening to people\u2019s concerns.\u201d[5]\nIt was announced on 6 January 2012 that Archbishop Braz de Aviz would be created a cardinal along with 21 others on 18 February. He was created Cardinal-Deacon of Sant\u2019Elena fuori Porta Prenestina. On 21 April 2012 Cardinal Braz de Aviz was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Clergy and the Congregation for Catholic Education.[6]\n[edit] Papabile\nOn 11 February 2013, Pope Benedict XVI announced that he will resign on 28 February 2013.

He graduated from Our Lady of Solace School in 1953, and attended St. Mary's High School in Katonah from 1953 to 1957. He then entered St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers in 1959, from where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts (1961), Master of Divinity (1964), and Master of Arts (1965) degrees.[2]\n[edit] Priesthood\nO'Brien was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Francis Spellman on May 29, 1965.[3] He then served as a civilian chaplain at the United States Military Academy at West Point until 1970, whence he became an army chaplain with the rank of Captain.[2] He also took flight training that required him to parachute out of airplanes.[4] O'Brien was a chaplain at Fort Bragg in North Carolina with the 82nd Division (1970\u201371), and in Vietnam with the 173rd Airborne Brigade and 1st Cavalry Brigade (1971\u201372).[5] While in Vietnam, he was based in a jungle and flew with a Protestant minister by helicopter to minister to soldiers.[2] From 1972 to 1973, he was a post chaplain at Fort Gordon in Georgia.\nO'Brien was then sent by Cardinal Terence Cooke to study at the Pontifical North American College in Rome in 1973, and earned a Doctorate in Sacred Theology from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in 1976; his dissertation was titled: \"The Origin and Development of Moral Principles in the Theology of Paul Ramsey.\"[2] Upon his return to the United States, he served as both the vice-chancellor of the Archdiocese of New York and associate pastor at St. Patrick Cathedral from 1976 to 1981.[2] O'Brien coordinated Pope John Paul II's visit to New York in 1979, and was the archdiocesan Director of Communications from 1981 to 1983.[2] Between 1983 and 1985, he served as private secretary to Cardinal Cooke and then to his successor, Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor.[2]\nO'Brien was raised to the rank of Honorary Prelate of His Holiness in 1986.[2] He served as rector of St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers from 1985 to 1989, and of the North American College in Rome from 1990 to 1994. Returning to New York, he served another term as rector of St. Joseph's from 1994 to 1997.[5]\n[edit] Episcopal career\n\n\nStyles of\nEdwin Frederick O'Brien\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nnone\n\n\nOn February 6, 1996, O'Brien was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of Thizica by John Paul II.[3] He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 25 from Cardinal O'Connor, with Bishops Patrick Sheridan and John Nolan serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral.[3] He selected as his episcopal motto: Pastores Dabo Vobis, meaning, \"I will give you shepherds\" (Jeremiah 3:15).[2]\n[edit] Archbishop for the Military Services\nO'Brien was later named Coadjutor Archbishop for the Military Services on April 7, 1997.[3] He succeeded Joseph Thomas Dimino as Archbishop for the Military Services upon the latter's retirement on August 12 of that year. As archbishop, O'Brien served as head of the American Catholic military ordinariate, ministering to 1.5 million Catholics in the armed forces and providing oversight to 300 Catholic chaplains.[6] He also abdicated his titular see of Thizica on March 7, 1998.[3]\nDuring his decade-long tenure, he divided his time between visiting American troops and working with the North American College. He was greatly involved in the case of Eugene Hamilton, a 25-year-old seminarian who was diagnosed with terminal cancer during the course of his studies.[7] O'Brien successfully petitioned the Vatican for Hamilton's early ordination, and ordained him a priest only hours before he died.[7] In 1993, he initiated the cause of canonization for Emil Kapaun, a chaplain killed during the Korean War.[8]\nFrom September 2005 to June 2006, the Archbishop served in the additional role of the Vatican's coordinator for the Papal Visitation of Seminaries and Houses of Priestly Formation.[2][9] He expressed his personal opposition to admitting homosexuals to seminaries, a position he said was \"based on 12 years' experience as rector of two U.S. seminaries.\"[10][11] His report also called for a stronger focus on moral theology, increased oversight of seminarians and greater involvement of diocesan bishops in the formation process. He was recognized as being \"instrumental in Catholic seminary reform in the wake of clergy sex abuse disclosures.\"[6]\nIn 2006, O'Brien noted that declining public support for war in Iraq was also leading to a decrease in morale among the troops, adding, \"The news only shows cars being blown up, but the soldiers see hospitals being built and schools opening.\"[12] By 2007, he believed that the state of the operation \"compels an assessment of our current circumstances and the continuing obligation of the Church to provide a moral framework for public discussion.\"[7] He refused to \"question the moral integrity of our military personnel,\" but added, \"[O]ur nation must honestly assess what is achievable in Iraq using the traditional just war principles of 'probability of success'...Our troops should remain in Iraq only as long as their presence contributes to a responsible transition.\"[7][13]\nHe opposed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007, claiming it \"would seek to impose a legislative mandate for military chaplains without considering the religious needs of all military members...[and] may well result in less public prayer and marginalization of military chaplains.\"[14] He became a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education in the Roman Curia in May 2007.[15]\n[edit] Archbishop of Baltimore\nPope Benedict XVI appointed O'Brien the fifteenth Archbishop of Baltimore, Maryland, on July 12, 2007.[3] Recalling the call he received from the Apostolic Nunciature, O'Brien immediately accepted the appointment and later remarked, \"I guess that's one thing I take from the military. When you're given an order, you accept.\"[16] He also felt \"deep sadness\" over leaving the military archdiocese, but pledged to give himself \"to the task of making Jesus Christ known by preaching his word and serving his people\" in his new post.[16] He succeeded Cardinal William Henry Keeler, and was formally installed as Archbishop at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen on the following October 1.[3] As head of the nation's oldest diocese, he served as the spiritual leader of over 500,000 Catholics in Maryland and held the status of primus inter pares in the American hierarchy.\nCommenting on O'Brien's appointment, The Baltimore Sun said, \"He has leapt from military airplanes, served in jungles during the Vietnam War and travelled extensively to current battle zones in Afghanistan and Iraq. From his working-class roots...to the upper echelons of Catholic power\u2014carrying a Christian message of peace and love to some of the world's worst war-torn terrain\".[17] The Baltimore Examiner described him as \"Army jump school-qualified and troubleshooter for God at Catholic seminaries and remote Vietnam War firebases alike.\"[6] Following his tour of the Archdiocese, O'Brien lamented the large presence of poverty and violence in Baltimore, saying, \"I think anybody who wants to take a walk can find areas with very nice homes, well-kept lawns, good streets and sidewalks, and maybe 15 minutes later find themselves in a neighborhood that is just racked, torn apart, as if a war had just been fought.\"[18]\nOn June 29, 2008, O'Brien was invested with the pallium, a vestment worn by metropolitan bishops, by Benedict XVI at St. Peter's Basilica.[19] He dedicated the Pope John Paul II Prayer Garden, which he has called a \"sanctuary in a suffering city,\" in downtown Baltimore in October 2008.[20]\nArchbishop O'Brien's reign, at just 3 years and 11 months since his October 2007 installation, was one of the briefest among the see's ordinaries. John Carroll's immediate successor, Leonard Neale, SJ died in a carriage accident in June 1817, barely 18 months after acceding to the archbishopric upon Carroll's own death. His departure also marked the first time since 1947, when Archbishop Michael Curley died after a 26-year reign, that the see of Baltimore fell vacant.\n[edit] Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem\nArchbishop O'Brien was appointed Pro-Grand Master on August 29, 2011, succeeding John Patrick Foley, who resigned in February 2011, having reached the age limit, in addition to poor health. On August 17, 2011, Cardinal Bertone asked Archbishop O'Brien to take the position, while O'Brien was visiting Rome, and O'Brien formally wrote to Pope Benedict on August 18, 2011 accepting the appointment.[21]\nArchbishop O'Brien's health, in addition to his enjoyment of travel and knowledge of geopolitical situations during his decade as head of the archdiocese for the Military Services, are thought to have been part of the reason for his appointment. Archbishop O'Brien will lead the papal order of knighthood in its goals to: strengthen in its members the practice of Christian life; to sustain and aid the charitable, cultural, and social works and institutions of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, particularly those of and in the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem; to support the preservation and propagation of the Faith in those lands; and to sustain the rights of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land.[citation needed]\nOn January 6, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI announced that Archbishop O'Brien would be elevated to Cardinal, along with 21 other prelates. The formal celebration, to be held on February 18, 2012, was announced at this time. During the ceremony he was created Cardinal-Deacon of San Sebastiano al Palatino. This was the same titular church held by his predecessor as Grand Master, Cardinal Foley.\nCardinal O'Brien was named Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem on March 15, 2012.[22][23]\nOn April 21, 2012 Cardinal O'Brien was named a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches and the Pontifical Council ''Cor Unum''[24] in addition to his membership of the Congregation for Catholic Education. He will lose these memberships on his 80th birthday.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Abortion\nO'Brien has called abortion the \"greatest civil rights issue of our time,\" saying, \"[ The right to life ] will determine whether America remains a hospitable society: committed to caring for women in crisis and their unborn children; committed to caring for those with special needs; committed to caring for the elderly and the dying; or whether America betrays our heritage and the truths on which its founders staked its claim to independence.\"[25] During the 2008 presidential election, he lamented that the \"clear and unchanged teaching of our Church from its earliest days has been so distorted in political debate and commentary,\"[26] an indirect criticism of remarks made by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then-Senator Joe Biden concerning the Church's teaching on abortion. In March 2009, he said he was both \"disappointed and bewildered\" by the decision of the University of Notre Dame to have President Barack Obama deliver the commencement speech and receive an honorary degree at the university's graduation ceremony, given Obama's support for legal abortion and embryonic stem-cell research.[27]\n[edit] Capital punishment\nArchbishop O'Brien has also expressed his opposition to capital punishment, although he had previously \"thought it served a purpose.\"[28]\n[edit] Legionaries of Christ\nSince becoming Archbishop of Baltimore, O'Brien has been an outspoken critic of the controversial religious institute, the Legion of Christ.[29][30][31] He has particularly objected to its alleged practice of \"blind allegiance\",[29] lack of \"respect for human dignity for each of its members,\"[30] and \"heavily persuasive methods on young people, especially high schoolers, regarding vocations.\"[32] In June 2008, O'Brien called for greater \"transparency and accountability\" from the Legionaries and its lay arm Regnum Christi.[29] He initially intended to expel the Legionaries from his archdiocese, but was persuaded by the Vatican instead to engage in dialogue with the institute's superior general, \u00c1lvaro Corcuera Mart\u00ednez del R\u00edo.[29] He has since directed both groups to disclose all activities within the Archdiocese of Baltimore, and to refrain from spiritual direction with anyone under eighteen years of age.\nIn February 2009, when the Legionaries acknowledged that their founder, Marcial Maciel, had engaged in \"inappropriate\" behavior (including accusations of drug and sexual abuse as well as fathering a child[33]),[34] O'Brien told his archdiocesan newspaper that the institute must offer \"full disclosure of [Maciel's] activities and those who are complicit in them, or knew of them, and of those who are still refusing to offer disclosure,\" adding that the institute's finances should also be subject to \"objective scrutiny.\"[31] He called Maciel \"a man with an entrepreneurial genius who, by systematic deception and duplicity, used our faith to manipulate others for his own selfish ends,\"[30] and further criticized the \"good deal of secrecy in [Maciel's] own life...[and] in the structures he created.\"[31] The Archbishop welcomed the Vatican's decision in the following March to conduct an apostolic visitation of the Legionaries, and said that the institute's abolition \"should be on the table.\"[31]\n[edit] See also\n\n\n\n\nBiography  portal\n\n\n\nUnited States Army  portal\n\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ RINUNCIA DEL GRAN MAESTRO DELL'ORDINE EQUESTRE DEL SANTO SEPOLCRO DI GERUSALEMME E NOMINA DEL PRO-GRAN MAESTRO DEL MEDESIMO ORDINE EQUESTRE\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k \"Most.
