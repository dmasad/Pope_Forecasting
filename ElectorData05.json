He is Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, having served as prefect from 2002 to 2008. He is the current Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni (succeeding Joseph Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI) since 2005. Arinze was one of the principal advisors to Pope John Paul II, and was considered papabile before the 2005 papal conclave, which elected Benedict XVI.[2]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life\n2 As priest\n3 As bishop\n4 As archbishop\n5 As cardinal\n6 Publications\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life\nArinze was born in Eziowelle, Anambra State, Nigeria, Africa. A convert from an African traditional religion,[3] he was baptized on his ninth birthday (1 November 1941) by Father Michael Tansi, who was beatified by John Paul II in 1998. His parents later converted to Catholicism. At age 15, he entered All Hallows Seminary of Onitsha from which he graduated and earned a philosophy degree in 1950. His father was initially opposed to his entering the seminary, but after seeing how much Francis enjoyed it, he encouraged him. Arinze stayed at All Hallows until 1953 to teach. In 1955, he went to Rome to study theology at the Pontifical Urban University, where he ultimately earned a doctorate in sacred theology summa cum laude. On 23 November 1958, at the chapel of the university, Arinze was ordained to the priesthood by Gr\u00e9goire-Pierre Agagianian, pro-prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith and future cardinal.\n[edit] As priest\nAfter ordination, Father Arinze remained in Rome, earning a master's in theology in 1959 and doctorate in 1960. His doctoral thesis on \"Ibo Sacrifice as an Introduction to the Catechesis of Holy Mass\" was the basis for his much used reference work, \"Sacrifice in Ibo Religion\", published in 1970. From 1961 to 1962, Arinze was professor of liturgy, logic, and basic philosophy at Bigard Memorial Seminary. From there, he was appointed regional secretary for Catholic education for the eastern part of Nigeria. Eventually, Arinze was transferred to London, where he attended the Institute of Education and graduated in 1964.\n[edit] As bishop\nFrancis Arinze became the youngest Roman Catholic bishop in the world when he was ordained to the episcopate on 29 August 1965, at the age of 32. He was appointed titular bishop of Fissiana, and named coadjutor to the Archbishop of Onitsha, Nigeria. He attended the final session of the Second Vatican Council in that same year along with the 45 year old Archbishop of Krakow, Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II. Following the death of the Archbishop of Onitsha in February 1967, Arinze was appointed to the position a few months later, on 26 June 1967. He was the first native African to head his diocese, succeeding Archbishop Charles Heerey, an Irish missionary.\n[edit] As archbishop\nThe new Archbishop did not have much time to settle into his office before the Nigeria-Biafra War broke out. The entire archdiocese was located in the secessionist Biafran territory. As a result of the war, Archbishop Arinze had to flee his see city of Onitsha and to live as a refugee, first in Adazi and then Amichi, for the three years of the war, which lasted from 1967 to 1970.\nDespite his own refugee status, Archbishop Arinze worked tirelessly for refugees, displaced persons, the sick and the hungry, offering support to priests and religious, and giving the faithful hope for the future. With the help of foreign missionaries, he supervised what one international relief worker called one of \"the most effective and efficient distributions of relief materials\" in history. He also took care to keep the Church separate from the ongoing political conflict, gaining the respect of all factions in the country.\nFrancis Arinze was still Archbishop of Onitsha when the Nigeria-Biafra war ended in 1970. As a part of Biafra, Onitsha and its people had suffered greatly in the three-year war. The homes and businesses of the people had been devastated, and the already poor region was sinking deeper into poverty. The end of the war did not mean an end to the challenges facing the young Archbishop.\nThe Nigerian government deported all foreign missionaries stationed in the archdiocese, leaving only the native clergy and religious, who were few in number. The government also confiscated the Catholic schools, most of which also served as churches or parish halls.\nImpressed by Arinze's many accomplishments as the leader of an archdiocese with few resources, and his ability to work side by side with Muslims in a country that is majority Christian (the fearful refusal of Muslims in the north, where they are a local majority, not to allow religion and ethnicity to feature in the recent census in Nigeria is viewed by analysts as an acknowledgement of the Christian numerical superiority in the country as a whole) [citation needed], and with a strong and not-to-be-ignored Muslim population, Pope John Paul II in 1979 appointed Arinze pro-president of the Vatican's Secretariat for Non-Christians, later renamed the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue. Archbishop Arinze continued as the ordinary of his archdiocese, and was the unanimous choice of his brother bishops for President of the Nigerian Bishops Conference in 1984.\nA year later, the people of Onitsha organized a pilgrimage to Rome when they learned that Archbishop Arinze would be named a Cardinal at the Consistory of 25 May 1985.\n[edit] As cardinal\n\n\nStyles of\nFrancis Arinze\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nVelletri (suburbicarian see)\n\n\nOn 8 April 1985, Arinze resigned from his post in Onitsha, and the Pope named him a Cardinal-Deacon of San Giovanni della Pigna, little more than a month later in the consistory held on 25 May 1985; he was raised to the rank of cardinal-priest in 1996. Two days following his elevation to cardinal deacon, Arinze was appointed President of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue.\nIn this position, Arinze's visibility to the world public increased. This post is largely considered to have made Cardinal Francis Arinze's career. He served in various related capacities including the president of the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops. He also received honours in this capacity: On 24 October 1999 he received a gold medallion from the International Council of Christians and Jews for his outstanding achievements in inter-faith relations. He traveled extensively and became a popular speaker in the United States.\nCardinal Arinze became even more visible to the public as a member of the Committee of the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. In that capacity, he worked closely with individual bishops and priests throughout the world in preparation for the rare celebration of the Church. Pope John Paul II was greatly impressed with the leadership of Cardinal Arinze and on 1 October 2002, Arinze was named prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.\nWhen Pope John Paul II died on 2 April 2005, all major Vatican officials - including Arinze - automatically lost their positions. Arinze was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. He returned to his post as prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship when confirmed by Benedict on 21 April 2005. Four days later, on 25 April 2005, he was advanced to Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni, which had been vacated by the ascension of Cardinal Ratzinger to the papacy.\nOn 9 December 2008 Benedict accepted the resignation of Arinze as prefect of the Congregation of Divine Worship. His successor, who took office that same day, is Cardinal Antonio Ca\u00f1izares Llovera.[4] On 1 November 2012 Cardinal Arinze lost his eligibility to participate and vote in any future conclaves occurring as the result of any period of sede vacante.\nArinze remains active and in 2009 gave the commencement address at the Augustine Institute in Denver. He actively catechises via Familyland TV to the Americas, the Philippines, Africa, and Europe. He has produced over 1,700 television programs with the Apostolate for Family Consecration. The programs cover almost all of Pope John Paul II's encyclicals and apostolic letters, Vatican II, and many other topics. In July 2009, he delivered a major speech promoting interreligious dialogue at The City Club of Cleveland.[5] He is also the author of several books along with a complete \"Consecration and Truth Catechetical Program\" for children and adults.\n[edit] Publications\n\nThe Family Catechism on Tape, Apostolate for Family Consecration\nDivine Providence: God's Design in Your Life (2005)\nBuilding Bridges: Interreligious Dialogue on the Path to World Peace (2004)\nCardinal Reflections: Active Participation and the Liturgy (2005)\nThe Holy Eucharist (Our Sunday Visitor, 2001) ISBN 0-87973-978-9\nThe Church in Dialogue: Walking With Other Believers (1990)\nMeeting Other Believers: The Risks and Rewards of Interreligious Dialogue (1998)\nCelebrating the Holy Eucharist (2006)\nReligions for Peace (Darton, Longman & Todd, 2002)\nGod's Invisible Hand: The Life and Work of Francis Cardinal Arinze, Ignatius Press, 2006\nGreat Figures in Salvation History: David and Solomon, an interview with Cardinal Arinze and Roy Schoemann, Ignatius Press, 2006\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Loyn, David (18 April 2005). \"Profile: Cardinal Francis Arinze\".

He served as Bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau (1970\u201373) and Archbishop of Washington (1973\u201380) before serving in the Roman Curia as Prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education (1980\u201390) and Major Penitentiary (1990\u20132001).[1] He was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1976, and is currently the longest-serving American cardinal in history.[2]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Priesthood\n3 Episcopal ministry\n\n3.1 Bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau\n3.2 Archbishop of Washington\n\n\n4 Career in the Roman Curia\n5 Later life\n6 References\n7 Episcopal succession\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and education\nWilliam Wakefield White was born in Dallas, Texas, to Harold E. and Mary Leona (n\u00e9e Hayes) White.[3] His father, Presbyterian, died when William was a young child, and he and his mother subsequently moved to Kansas City, Missouri.[4] His mother married Jerome Charles Baum, a Jewish businessman, who adopted William and gave him his last name.[5]\nHe received his early education at the parochial school of St. Peter's Church, and began to serve as an altar boy at age 10.[6] He entered St. John's Minor Seminary in 1940, and then studied philosophy at Glennon College in St. Louis.[5] In 1947, he entered Kenrick Seminary, also in St. Louis, for his theological studies.[6]\n[edit] Priesthood\nBaum was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Edwin V. O'Hara on May 12, 1951.[1] His first assignment was as assistant pastor of St. Aloysius Church in Kansas City.[7] He taught theology and Church history at St. Theresa College from 1954 to 1956, as well as at St. Aloysius Academy and Glennon High School.[4] He then furthered his studies at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome, where he earned a Doctorate of Sacred Theology degree in 1958.[3] His thesis was entitled: \"The Teaching of Cardinal Cajetan on the Sacrifice of the Mass\".[4]\nReturning to Kansas City, Baum resumed his teaching duties at St. Theresa College (1958\u201363) and served as secretary of the Diocesan Tribunal.[5] He also did pastoral work at St. Theresa's Church and St. Peter's Church, both in Kansas City.[6] In 1960, he became pastor of St. Cyril's Church in Sugar Creek.[5] He published \"Considerations Toward the Theology of the Presbyterate\" in 1961.[8] He was named a papal chamberlain by Pope John XXIII in April 1961, and vice-chancellor of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph in 1962.[3]\nFrom 1962 to 1965, Baum served as a peritus, or theological expert, to Bishop Charles Helmsing at the Second Vatican Council.[6] In that capacity, he worked with the Secretariat for Christian Unity and helped draft Unitatis Redintegratio, the Council's decree on ecumenism.[5] In 1964, he was named the first executive director of the Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, a post which he held for five years.[8] He also served as a member of the Joint Working Group of representatives of the Catholic Church and World Council of Churches (1965\u201369) and of the Mixed Committee of representatives of the Catholic Church and the Lutheran World Federation (1965\u201366).[6]\nIn 1967, Baum returned to Kansas City, where he served as chancellor of the diocese and pastor of St. James Church.[7] He was named a domestic prelate in 1968.[3]\n[edit] Episcopal ministry\n[edit] Bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau\nOn February 18, 1970, Baum was appointed the third Bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau by Pope Paul VI.[1] He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 6 from Cardinal John Carberry, with Bishops Charles Helmsing and Joseph Sullivan serving as co-consecrators.[1] He selected as his episcopal motto: \"Ministry of Reconciliation\" (2\u00a0Corinthians 5:18).[8]\nHe served as an American delegate to the World Synod of Bishops at the Vatican in 1971, and was chairman of the Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs (1972\u201375).[3]\n[edit] Archbishop of Washington\nThree years later Paul VI elevated him to Archbishop of Washington, D.C. (his successor in Springfield-Cape Girardeau being Bernard Francis Law, another future cardinal); and in the consistory of 1976 Baum was named Cardinal-Priest of S. Croce in via Flaminia. He participated in the two conclaves of 1978.[9]\n[edit] Career in the Roman Curia\nUnder Pope John Paul II, Baum's rise continued, as in 1980 he was named to the Roman Curia as Prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education. In 1990 he became the Church's Major Penitentiary, exchanging the responsibility of overseeing church seminaries worldwide for that of supervising the office in charge of the forgiveness of sins.\nBaum was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. Along with Benedict (then Cardinal Ratzinger) and Cardinal Jaime Sin, Baum was one of three remaining cardinals elevated by Paul VI to retain voting rights in that conclave, though two more who had already died years before John Paul, Ant\u00f3nio Ribeiro and Emile Biayenda, would have been eligible to vote had they remained alive. Cardinal Baum was the senior Cardinal Priest to participate in the 2005 papal conclave.[10]\n[edit] Later life\nSomewhat frail in recent years, Cardinal Baum has suffered from deteriorating eyesight. His resignation as Penitentiary was accepted the day after his 75th birthday in 2001, but he has remained active in Rome to the extent that his health permits, and attended the meeting of American cardinals called to deal with the sex abuse scandal in 2003.\nWith the election of Ratzinger as pope on April 19, 2005, followed by the death of Cardinal Jaime Sin on June 21, 2005, Baum became the last cardinal elevated by Pope Paul VI to maintain voting rights in a papal conclave. Since Baum reached the age of 80 on November 21, 2006, all cardinals who may vote in a conclave have been elevated by Pope John Paul II or Pope Benedict XVI.\nOn March 8, 2011, Baum surpassed James Gibbons of Baltimore to become the longest-serving American cardinal of all time.\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c d \"William Wakefield Cardinal Baum\".

By virtue of this position, he was also Permanent Observer to the Organization of American States and the Holy See's representative to the World Association of Jurists.[2]\n[edit] Within the Roman Curia\nPope John Paul II appointed Archbishop Cacciavillan as President of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See on 5 November 1998.[1] According to Pastor Bonus, the Administration deals with the \"properties owned by the Holy See in order to provide the funds necessary for the Roman Curia to function.\"[5] He was created Cardinal-Deacon of Santi Angeli Custodi a Citt\u00e0 Giardino in the consistory of 21 February 2001. He retired from his post as President on 1 October 2002.[1]\nCardinal Cacciavillan was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.[2] In accordance with the rules of Universi Dominici Gregis, he lost the right to vote in any further papal conclaves upon reaching the age of eighty in August 2006.\nFollowing the elevation of Cardinal Dar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos to the rank of Cardinal-Priest on 1 March 2008, Cacciavillan, as the longest serving Cardinal-Deacon (in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals), became Cardinal Protodeacon, whose special privilege it is to make the Habemus Papam announcement upon the conclusion of a papal conclave.[2] He lost this position on 21 February 2011, having opted for the order of Cardinal Priest, with his former diaconal church elevated to the level of cardinalitial title.[6]\nIn the Roman Curia, he also held membership in the Congregation for Bishops, Congregation for Oriental Churches, Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, Congregation for the Causes of Saints, Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts, Pontifical Commission for Latin America, and Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State.He lost these positions on reaching his 80th birthday[7]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c d e \"Agostino Cardinal Cacciavillan\".

He served as president of the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts in the Roman Curia from 1994 to 2007, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 2003.\nOne of two cardinals\u2014along with Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne\u2014who belong to Opus Dei, Herranz Casado is the organisation's highest-ranking member in the Church's hierarchy. He is also considered one of the foremost experts in canon law, and to have been one of the Vatican's most influential figures during the period shortly before the death of Pope John Paul II.\n[edit] Biography\nBorn in Baena in the Province of C\u00f3rdoba, Herranz Casado joined Opus Dei in 1949 after reading a conspiratorial story about it as editor of a university newspaper.[1] He was ordained as a priest of Opus Dei on 7 August 1955 by Bishop Juan Ricote Alonso, after obtaining doctorates in medicine from the Universities of Barcelona and Navarra and in canon law from the Angelicum in Rome.[2] He taught canon law at the University of Navarra and travelled worldwide on behalf of Opus Dei until 1960, when he began to work for the Roman Curia.\nDuring the Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965), Herranz Casado served as an assistant of study on the commissions for discipline of clergy and the Christian people. In 1983, he was appointed secretary for the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of the Code of Canon Law. On 15 December 1990, he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Vertara by Pope John Paul II. Herranz Casado received his episcopal consecration on 6 January 1991 from John Paul II himself, with Archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Justin Francis Rigali serving as co-consecrators, in St. Peter's Basilica. On 9 December 1994, he was named President of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts for the Roman Curia, a position in which he was responsible for advising the pope on matters of Church law.\n\n\nStyles of\nJuli\u00e1n Herranz Casado\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nVertara (titular)\n\n\nHe was created Cardinal-Deacon of S. Eugenio by John Paul II in the consistory of 21 October 2003.\nAccording to Vatican journalist Sandro Magister, by the end of 2004, Herranz Casado was \"constantly gaining influence\" in the internal affairs of the Vatican. Along with Joseph Ratzinger, Angelo Sodano, and the Pope's private secretary, Archbishop Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, Herranz Casado is believed to have been largely responsible for leading the Curia at times when the Pope was incapacitated by illness.[3] Herranz finds conspiracy theories about Opus Dei particularly offensive, claiming that it has \"no hidden agenda. The only policy is the message of Christ\".[4]\nUpon the death of John Paul II on 2 April 2005, Cardinal Herranz Casado and all major Vatican officials automatically lost their positions during the sede vacante. Herranz Casado was later confirmed as president of Legislative Texts by Pope Benedict XVI on the following 21 April.[5] He was one of the cardinal electors in the 2005 papal conclave yet was not generally considered a strong candidate for the papacy himself; instead, he was described as a highly influential insider, potentially playing the role of a \"kingmaker\" at the conclave. It has been reported that, both before and after Pope John Paul's death, Herranz convened meetings of cardinals at a villa in Grottarossa, a suburb of Rome.[6]\nPope Benedict XVI accepted Herranz's resignation as President of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts on February 15, 2007,[7] after twelve years of service.\nPope Benedict XVI established a Commission of Cardinals to investigate recent leaks of reserved and confidential documents on television, in newspapers, and in other communications media. It first met on Tuesday, April 24, 2012. Cardinal Herranz serves as the Chair, and he will be accompanied by Cardinals Jozef Tomko and Salvatore De Giorgi.[8]\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nVincenzo Fagiolo\nPresident of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts\n19 December 1994\u20132 April 2005; 21 April 2005\u201315 February 2007\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nFrancesco Coccopalmerio\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n^ TIME Magazine.

He earned a degree in Canon law at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. On 18 September 1977 he was consecrated Bishop of Cairo by Patriarch Ignatius Antony II Hayyek. In 1994 he was appointed Archbishop of Homs of the Catholic Syrians.\nThen-Archbishop Moses Daoud was elected Patriarch of Antioch for the Syrian Catholic Church on 13 October 1998. He was confirmed as Patriarch of Antioch by Blessed Pope John Paul II on 20 October 1998, and was enthroned as Patriarch of Antioch on 25 October 1998. By custom, he added the name Ignatius to his own name, honoring Saint Ignatius of Antioch. He retired from the Patriarchal See on 8 January 2001, shortly after being named Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, which deals with Vatican relations with the Eastern-Rite Churches in communion with Rome, by Pope John Paul II, on 25 November 2000.\nMoses Daoud was proclaimed Cardinal-Bishop by Pope John Paul in the consistory of 21 February 2001. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. On 9 June 2007, Patriarch Emeritus Ignatius Moses I resigned his post as Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.\nUntil his 80th birthday, when all Cardinals and Bishops generally automatically lose their posts and Curial memberships, he was a member of the following dicasteries of the Roman Curia:\n\nCongregation for the Doctrine of the Faith\nCongregation for the Causes of the Saints\nPontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity\nPontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative Texts\nSpecial Council for Lebanon of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops\n\nWhen he turned 80 years of age on 18 September 2010, he also lost the right to vote in future Papal Conclaves.\nHe died on 7 April 2012 in Rome. A funeral Mass in the Roman Rite took place on 10 April 2012, at Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, with the Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, former Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano, as principal celebrant. Cardinal Daoud's body was then flown to Beirut and with Syriac rites buried with other Patriarchs of Antioch in Sharfeh, Harissa, Lebanon on 16 April 2012. In his homily, Cardinal Sodano said he had visited the ailing Patriarch a few days before he died of complications from a cerebrovascular accident (CVA, or stroke). He said Cardinal Daoud told him he was \"offering to the Lord his suffering for the good of the holy Church and above all for the unity of all Christians\". In a message to the incumbent Syriac Patriarch of Antioch, Ignatius Joseph III Younan, Pope Benedict XVI called the Cardinal Patriarch \"a faithful Pastor who devoted himself with faith and generosity to the service of the people of God\". He went on to say that, \"these days, when we celebrate the resurrection of the Lord\", he was offering special prayers \"for the peoples of the region who are living through difficult times\".[1][2]\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nIgnatius Antony II Hayyek\nPatriarch of Antioch of the Syrian Catholic Church\n20 October 1998 \u2013 January 08, 2001\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nIgnatius Peter VIII Abdalahad\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAchille Silvestrini\nPrefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches\nNovember 25, 2000 \u2013 June 9, 2007\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nLeonardo Sandri\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1201435.htm\n^ http://www.catholicnews.com/data/briefs/cns/20120410.htm\n\n\n\n\"Ignace Moussa I (Basile) Cardinal Daoud\".

He was ordained a priest on June 12, 1954, by Bishop Pio Fari\u00f1a Fari\u00f1a, the vicar general and an auxiliary bishop of Santiago.\n[edit] Church scholar\nEarning a doctorate in theology in 1955, Medina taught philosophy and theology at the Major Seminary of Santiago and of the Pontifical Catholic University, respectively. He also served as a dean of the university, and as a peritus at the Second Vatican Council; for the latter he later received a honoris causa doctorate from the University of Notre Dame in 1996.\n[edit] Bishop\nPro-Grand Chancellor of the Catholic University from 1974 to 1985, he was named titular bishop of Thibilis and auxiliary bishop of Rancagua on December 18, 1984. Medina was consecrated to the episcopate on January 6, 1985 by Pope John Paul II himself, with Cardinals Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Somalo and Duraisamy Simon Lourdusamy acting as co-consecrators. He was made Bishop of Rancagua on November 25, 1987 and then Bishop of Valpara\u00edso on April 16, 1993.

After his 80th birthday he went back to Chile in order to help as a priest in a parish. On March 1, 2008, he was elevated to Cardinal-Priest, the deaconry of San Saba being elevated pro hac vice to a \"title\". i.e. to the rank of seat of a Cardinal Priest.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Madonna concert\nIn December 2008, while giving a mass for the soul of former dictator Augusto Pinochet, Medina spoke out against a visit to Chile by pop musician Madonna. Medina used the pulpit to indirectly condemn Madonna's \"performances\", stating that they encouraged impure thoughts and actions.[1]\n[edit] Pedophilia and homosexuality\nRegarding the prominent 80-year-old priest Fernando Karadima, whom in January 2011 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, finding him guilty of having sexually abused minors, ordered to retire to a life of prayer and penitence and never to exercise the priesthood in public again,[2][3] and who was then accused under Chilean civil law of sexual abuse of minors,[4][5] Medina doubted that he would be sent to prison, since homosexual activity was not a crime in Chilean civil law and use of the term \"sexual abuse\" could be questioned: \"With all due respect to the laws of my country, a child of 8 or 9 is very different from a 17-year-old ... A 17-year-old youngster knows what he is doing.\" He also remarked that priests are not immune from the devil's works: \"Any informed Christian knows we are prone to weakness because of our human fragility. The devil gets in where he can. Priests are not immune from his snares.\" He defended the canonical sanctions imposed on Karadima as being the heaviest that could be imposed short of laicization, and as having taken into account Karadima's age and merits.[4][6][7][8]\nOne of Karadima's accusers called the cardinal's remark about 17-year-olds \"an unwarranted attack\".[9] Another added that it was an attack not only on those who had denounced Karadima, but on all who were honestly looking for truth and justice for their lives. He regarded Medina's statements as \"extremely suspicious, as if he wanted to diminish the outline of these grave actions, reducing the issue to homosexuality in a very silly manner, as if, furthermore, homosexuality and abuse were synonymous\". The statements, he said, \"were an attempt to free from responsibility someone who took advantage of his position of power over more vulnerable persons\".[10]\n[edit] Trivia\n\nHis Eminence is a Doctor Scientiae et honoris causa from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.\nHe is also a Chaplain ad honorem of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta.\n\n[edit] References\n\n^ [1]\n^ New York Times\n^ EWTN\n^ a b Naci\u00f3n\n^ New York Times\n^ El Mercurio (blog)\n^ Standard Newswire\n^ Catholic News Agency\n^ La Tercera\n^ La Segunda\n\n[edit] External links\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to: Jorge Medina\n\n\n\nCardinal Jorge Medina Est\u00e9vez announces Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI) as the new Pope.\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAntonio Mar\u00eda Javierre Ortas\nPrefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship\nand the Discipline of the Sacraments\n1998\u20132002\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nFrancis Arinze\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nLuigi Poggi\nCardinal Protodeacon\nFebruary 24, 2005 \u2013 February 23, 2007\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nDar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 62609778\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nMedina Estevez, Jorge Arturo\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\nDecember 23, 1926\n\n\nPlace of birth\nSantiago, Chile\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6410/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 32322/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 29100/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 9979/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1713067-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130228035227 ", "Name": "Jorge Arturo Medina Est\u00e9vez"}, {"url": "/wiki/Zenon_Grocholewski", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Zenon Grocholewski\n\n\nPrefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education (for Seminaries and Institutes of Study)\n\n\nAppointed\n15 November 1999\n\n\nPredecessor\nPio Laghi\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of S.

After studying at the archdiocesan seminary of Pozna\u0144, Grocholewski, was ordained to the priesthood on 27 May 1963[2] by Archbishop Antoni Baraniak, who had also previously ordained him a subdeacon and deacon.[3]\nAfter his 21 December 1982 appointment as titular bishop of Acropolis,[3] he received his episcopal consecration on the following 6 January from John Paul II himself, with Archbishops Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Somalo and Duraisamy Lourdusamy serving as co-consecrators. Grocholewski was promoted to the rank of Archbishop on 16 December 1991. On 15 November 1999 he was appointed the prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education[4] and the Grand Chancellor of the Pontifical Gregorian University.[2]\nGrocholewski was created Cardinal-Deacon of San Nicola in Carcere by John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001.[3] Upon the death of Pope John Paul all major Vatican officials automatically lose their positions during a sede vacante, and the cardinal so lost his position on 2 April 2005 due to the death of the Pope. He was later confirmed to office by Pope Benedict XVI on 21 April. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.[5] On 21 February 2011, he opted for the order of Cardinal Priest, with his former diaconal church elevated to the level of cardinalitial title.[6]\nAlong with his native Polish, he speaks Latin, Italian, French, Spanish, and English.\nHe is a Curial member of the Doctrine of the Faith, Bishops (congregations), the Legislative Texts (council) and the Special Council for Oceania of the Secretariat General (Synod of Bishops)[7] Cardinal Grocholewski was also the official extraordinary envoy of the Pope to the 400th year foundation of the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, Manila, the oldest university in the Asia.\n[edit] Teaching Activities in Universities, Publications, and Honors\nThe Cardinal taught at the Faculty of Canon Law of the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome (1975-1999), and at the Faculty of Canon Law of the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome (1980-1984). He also gave lectures on Administrative Justice at the Studio Rotale of the Roman Rota (1986-1998).[8]\nBeing an author of numerous publications in different languages, His Eminence has been frequently invited to speak and to give talks at national and international conferences and conventions, held in various countries around the world. He is also connected with a number of Canon Law associations, and with the editorial boards of some academic reviews and journals.[8]\nAmong the many honors received by Zenon Cardinal Grocholewski are: 18 honorary Doctorates; the Grand Medal of San Gorazdo of the Ministry of Education of Slovakia (2000); the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit (Chile) (2003); the Grand Cross of Merit with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2005); the Commander\u2019s Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta (2009); Commander of l\u2019Ordre des Palmes acad\u00e9miques of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of France (2009).[8]\n[edit] Recent Important Act as Prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education\nIn March 2011 at a press conference to present the newly-published Decree on the Reform of Ecclesiastical Studies of Philosophy. Cardinal Grocholewski explained how the normative documents concerning ecclesiastical studies \u2013 and hence also philosophy \u2013 currently comprehend John Paul II's 1979 Apostolic Constitution \"Sapientia christiana\" and its norms of application issued in the same year by the Congregation for Catholic Education. \"Nonetheless\", he said, \"'Ecclesia semper est reformanda' in order to respond to the new demands of ecclesial life in changing historical-cultural circumstances and this also (perhaps especially) involves the academic world\". The reasons for the reform are, the cardinal explained, \"on the one hand, the shortcomings in philosophical formation at many ecclesiastical institutions, where precise points of reference are lacking especially as regards the subjects to be taught and the quality of teachers. ... On the other hand there is the conviction \u2013 expressed in John Paul II's 1998 Encyclical Fides et ratio of the importance of the metaphysical component of philosophy, ... and the awareness that philosophy is indispensable for theological formation\". For this reason today's decree of the congregation aims to re-evaluate philosophy, above all in the light of that Encyclical, ... restoring the 'original vocation' of philosophy; i.e., the search for truth and its sapiental and metaphysical dimension\".[9]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Nauka Polska\n^ a b Catholic Pages\n^ a b c Catholic Hierarchy\n^ Roman Curia, Congregation for Catholic Education, Profile\n^ Fox News, Fast Facts: List of Cardinal Electors, 18 April 2005\n^ Concistoro per il voto su alcune cause di canonizzazione 21 February 2011\n^ Catholic News Agency\n^ a b c Cf.

He was made a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 2003.\nHamao was born in Tokyo, the third son of the Viscount Shir\u014d Hamao (1896\u20131935), who was an adopted son of the Viscount Hamao Arata, the 8th President of University of Tokyo and the 11th Minister of Education.[1] His family home housed both Shinto and Buddhist shrines, but his widowed mother converted to Catholicism in 1942, and he and his brother Minoru were baptised in 1946. He studied at Hitotsubashi University and then joined a seminary. After further study at the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome, he was ordained as a priest on 21 December 1957.\nAfter his ordination, he returned to Tokyo, where he served as secretary to the Cardinal Archbishop, secretary of the archdiocesan liturgical commission and finally, parish priest of the Cathedral.\nHamao was on the hijacked Japan Airlines Flight 351 as a passenger in 1970.[2] He was appointed titular bishop of Oreto and auxiliary bishop of Tokyo on 5 February 1970, and was ordained a bishop on 29 April 1970. He was named Bishop of Yokohama on 30 October 1979, a post he held for almost 20 years until he resigned on 15 June 1998 to become President of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants. He was made an Archbishop at the same time. He was also head of the regional branch of the charity Caritas, and became president of the Japanese Episcopal Conference in 1995.\nHe was elevated to the College of Cardinals on 21 October 2003 by Pope John Paul II, Hamao held the title of Cardinal Deacon of St. John Bosco in Via Tuscolana. The same year, he had called for a Third Vatican Council to deal with the question of local church authority.[3]\nHe was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. He resigned from the Pontifical Council in March 2006, a month after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the beatification of 188 Japanese martyrs from the 17th century.\nHis late brother Minoru served Crown Prince Akihito as East Palace Chamberlain (t\u014dg\u016bjij\u016b, \u6771\u5bae\u4f8d\u5f93). Cardinal Hamao instructed Akihito in Latin, but criticised a perceived \"excessively Westernised\" bias and \"over-intellectualised\" theology in the Roman Catholic Church. Shortly after he urged Pope Benedict XVI to appoint more Asians to positions of power in the Roman Curia, Cardinal Ivan Dias became prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.\nCardinal Hamao died at age 77 of lung cancer in 2007.\n[edit] References\n\n^ \u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u540d\u5927\u8f9e\u5178+\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9:\u6d5c\u5c3e\u56db\u90ce (Unabridged Dictionary of Japanese People Plus: Shir\u014d Hamao) (in Japanese).

He was Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy from 1996 to 2006, and is the president emeritus of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei having served from 2000 until his retirement in 2009. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1998.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life\n2 Bishop\n3 Cardinal\n4 Retirement\n5 View on denouncing a paedophile priest to the civil authorities\n\n5.1 Irish cases\n\n\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life\nBorn in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos attended the seminaries in Antioquia and Santa Rosa de Osos before going to Rome to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Alfonso Carinci on 26 October 1952, in the basilica of Ss. XII Apostoli. He finished his studies at the Gregorian, from where he obtained a doctorate in canon law and specialization in religious sociology, political economics, and ethical economics. Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos also studied at the Sociological Faculty of the University of Louvain in Belgium.\nUpon returning to Colombia, he served as a curate for two rural parishes in Yarumal from 1954 to 1971. He then served as director of Cursillos, of the national pastoral program, and of the Legion of Mary. After becoming an official in the diocesan curia of Santa Rosa de Osos, Castrill\u00f3n was made director of radiophonic schools. In 1959 he became the diocesan delegate of Catholic Action, and also worked as ecclesiastical assistant to the Catholic Workers Youth. He did catechetical and curial work before serving as General Secretary of the Colombian Episcopal Conference.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn 2 June 1971, Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Pereira and Titular Bishop of Villa Regis by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 18 July from Archbishop \u00c1ngelo Palmas, with Archbishop An\u00edbal Mu\u00f1oz Duque and Bishop Baltasar \u00c1lvarez Restrepo serving as co-consecrators. Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos succeeded Alvarez Restrepo as Bishop of Pereira on 1 July 1976.\nDuring his time as Bishop of Pereira, Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos was reported to have walked the streets at night to help feed abandoned children.[1] While many Latin American bishops refused to accept contributions from suspected drug lords, Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos accepted donations for his diocese's charities, arguing that by accepting the funds, they would be diverted from funding crime and instead used to help the poor and needy. He said that when accepting such donations, he had warned the donors personally that their donations \"would not save their souls\".[1] Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos once disguised himself as a milkman to gain access to the home of drug lord Pablo Escobar, and after revealing himself, the bishop successfully persuaded Escobar to confess his sins.[1][2] Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos also served as Secretary General (1983\u20131987) and then President (1987\u20131991) of the Latin American Episcopal Conference, where he took a hard line stance opposing liberation theology, which was popular among leftist Latin American bishops at that time.\nCastrill\u00f3n Hoyos was advanced to Archbishop of Bucaramanga on 16 December 1992. He remained in that post until 15 June 1996, when he became Pro-Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy in the Roman Curia. In this capacity, he was responsible for the celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's priestly ordination that November.\n[edit] Cardinal\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Cardinal Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos\n\n\nJohn Paul II created him Cardinal-Deacon of SS. Nome di Maria al Foro Traiano in the consistory of 21 February 1998. Two days later, on 23 February, Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos was promoted to full Prefect of the Congregation for Clergy. On 26 October of that same year he served as papal envoy to the signing of the peace accord between Peru and Ecuador to settle their border dispute. During his tenure as Prefect, he expressed his disapproval of the zero-tolerance policy of the American bishops towards paedophile priests, saying that the bishops ignored such \"fundamental principles of the Church\" as forgiveness and conversion.[3] On 14 April 2000, he replaced Angelo Felici as President of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, the Curial office that handles the Vatican's relations with Traditionalist groups such as the Society of St. Pius X.\nUpon the death of John Paul II on 2 April 2005, Cardinal Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos and all major Vatican officials, in accord with custom, automatically lost their positions during the sede vacante. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected John Paul's successor Pope Benedict XVI, and was himself considered papabile\u2014a possible successor to the papacy. Pope Benedict later confirmed him as Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy and President of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei on the following 21 April.\nOn 31 October 2006, the Cardinal resigned as head of the Congregation for the Clergy, but remained as President of Ecclesia Dei. He became Protodeacon, or the senior Cardinal-Deacon, on 23 February 2007, and later participated in the May 2007 general conference of the Latin American Episcopal Conference, also attended by Pope Benedict, in Brazil. On 27 June 2007, Castrill\u00f3n, along with several other prelates, attended a briefing at the Apostolic Palace on Pope Benedict's impending motu proprio granting greater freedom to the Tridentine Mass.[4] On March 1, 2008 Castrill\u00f3n was elevated to Cardinal-Priest. His titular deaconry Ss. Nominis Mariae ad forum Traiani (Italian: Santissimo Nome di Maria al Foro Traiano) was elevated pro hac vice to title. Hoyos' successor as Cardinal protodeacon is Agostino Cacciavillan.\nHe was appointed Grand Prior of the Constantinian Order of St George by HRH Infante don Carlos, Duke of Calabria, on 27 February 2004. On 13 September 2007 Cardinal Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos was interviewed by Vatican Radio about the implementation of Pope Benedict's motu proprio, Summorum Pontificum.[5]\n[edit] Retirement\nCardinal Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos retired on 8 July 2009. On the same day, Pope Benedict issued the motu proprio Ecclesiae Unitatem, which attached the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. As a result of the motu proprio, William Levada, the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, became ex officio the President of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei.[6]\nCardinal Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos told the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung that it was a \"calumny\" to say that he had been informed of Richard Williamson's negationist views, in response to allegations by Bishop Anders Arborelius of Stockholm that the Holy See had prior knowledge of the controversy. He has argued that if anyone in the Vatican should have known about the matter, it was not himself but rather Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, due to the fact that Re is Prefect of the Congregation of Bishops, which is responsible for matters relating to non-missionary Latin-Rite ordinaries.[7][8]\n[edit] View on denouncing a paedophile priest to the civil authorities\nWhen heading the Vatican Congregation for the Clergy, Cardinal Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos congratulated a French bishop in a 2001 letter for not denouncing a sexually abusive priest to the police.[9] In the letter dated 8 September 2001, Cardinal Castrill\u00f3n backed French Bishop Pierre Pican's decision not to denounce a priest who was later sentenced to 18 years in jail for repeated rape of a boy and sexual assaults on 10 others. Pican, who received a suspended three-month jail sentence for not denouncing sexual abuse of minors, admitted in court he had kept Rev. Ren\u00e9 Bissey in parish work despite the fact the priest had admitted in the confessional committing pedophile acts. \"I congratulate you for not denouncing a priest to the civil administration,\" Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos wrote. \"You have acted well and I am pleased to have a colleague in the episcopate who, in the eyes of history and of all other bishops in the world, preferred prison to denouncing his son and priest.\" The letter cited Vatican documents and an epistle of Saint Paul to bolster its argument about special bishop-priest links.\nVatican spokesman Rev. Federico Lombardi did not dispute the letter's authenticity, but said it confirmed \"how opportune it was to centralize treatment of Catholic sex abuse cases by clerics under the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\" Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos justified his actions, saying the late Pope John Paul II authorised him to send the letter. \"After consulting the Pope, I wrote a letter to the bishop, congratulating him as a model of a father who does not turn in his children,\" he said.[10]\nThe full text of the letter[11] translated into English is:\n\nCONGREGATIO PRO CLERICIS The Vatican, 8 September 2001 Most Reverend Excellency I write to you as Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy entrusted with aiding the Holy Father is his responsibility for the priests of the world. I congratulate you on not denouncing a priest to the civil authorities. You have acted wisely, and I am delighted to have a fellow member of the episcopate who, in the eyes of history and of other bishops, would prefer to go to prison rather than denounce his priest-son For the relationship between priests and their bishop is not professional but a sacramental relationship which forges very special bonds of spiritual paternity. The matter was amply taken up again by the last Council, by the 1971 Synod of Bishops and that of 1991. The bishop has other means of acting, as the Conference of French Bishops recently restated; but a bishop cannot be required to make the denunciation himself. In all civilised legal systems it is acknowledged that close relations have the possibility of not testifying against a direct relative. In this regard we remind you of the words of Saint Paul \"So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear\" (Philippians 1, v 13-14) This Congregation, in order to encourage brothers in the episcopate in this delicate matter, will forward a copy of this letter to all the conferences of bishops. Assuring you of my fraternal closeness in the Lord, I send my greetings to you, your auxiliary and your whole diocese (Castrill\u00f3n's signature) To His Most Reverend Excellency\nSE Mgr Pierre Pican\nBishop of Bayeux-Lisieux\n\n[edit] Irish cases\nIn January 2011 it was revealed that in 1997, Cardinal Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos expressed to the Irish bishops reservations of the Congregation of the Clergy, which he headed, concerning the proposals contained in a document of the Irish Catholic Bishops' Advisory Committee entitled \"Child Sexual Abuse: Framework for a Church Response\".[12]\nWhile indicating that the Congregation was still studying the question and would \"at the appropriate time\" establish \"some concrete directives\", it remarked that some of the proposals in the document \"appear contrary to canonical discipline\", so that actions taken in accordance with them could be overturned if an appeal were made to a higher level; accordingly the Congregation emphasized \"the need for this document to conform to the canonical norms presently in force.\"[12]\nIt mentioned in particular, as giving rise to \"serious reservations of a moral and canonical nature\" the proposed policy of mandatory reporting to the civil authorities.[12]\nIrish television network RTE aired on 17 January 2011 a report under the title \"Unspeakable Crimes\",[13] which dealt with this and other disagreements between the Irish bishops and Castrill\u00f3n on the proper treatment of priests accused of sex abuse. The documentary offered strong support for former Archbishop of Dublin Cardinal Desmond Connell, who had been the target of savage criticism, and put a new perspective on the efforts of the Irish hierarchy in general. It reported that in 1999 Castrill\u00f3n told the Irish bishops to be \"fathers to your priests, not policemen\". The programme also highlighted policy differences between the Congregation for Clergy and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed by then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI), which in 2001 secured that that all such allegations should be handled by it, not by the other congregation. The programme was devastating in its presentation of Cardinal Castrill\u00f3n.[14]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c Allen, John L, Jr. \"These Paths Lead to Rome\".

He returned to his studies and earned a doctorate in dogmatic theology from the University of T\u00fcbingen. He was a faculty member at T\u00fcbingen from 1958 to 1961 and worked for three years as an assistant to the conservative Leo Scheffczyk and the liberal Hans K\u00fcng, who was banned from teaching by Vatican authorities owing to his critical views on contraception and papal infallibility.\nHe later taught dogmatic theology at the Westphalian University of M\u00fcnster (1964\u20131970), rising to become dean of the theological faculty in 1969 and then the same in T\u00fcbingen in 1970. In 1983, Kasper taught as a visiting professor at The Catholic University of America. He was editor of the Lexikon f\u00fcr Theologie und Kirche.\n[edit] Bishop and cardinal\n[edit] Bishop of Rottenburg-Stuttgart\nKasper was named Bishop of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, Germany's fourth largest Catholic diocese, on 17 April 1989. He was consecrated as a bishop on 17 June that same year by Archbishop Oskar Saier of Freiburg im Breisgau; Bishops Karl Lehmann and Franz Kuhnle served as co-consecrators. In 1993 he and other members of the German episcopate signed a pastoral letter allowing divorced and civilly remarried German Catholics to return to the sacraments, to the disapproval of then Cardinal Ratzinger. In 1994, he was named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.\n[edit] Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity\nOn 3 March 1999, Kasper was appointed President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity - and as such, President of the Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews - and resigned from his post in Rottenburg-Stuttgart. He was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001 (along with Leo Scheffczyk), as Cardinal-Deacon of Ognissanti in Via Appia Nuova. He was critical of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith document Dominus Iesus, issued in 2000, which he believed was an offense to the Jewish people. He was often criticised by conservatives for his role in ecumenism. In February 2011 Cardinal Kasper revealed the that over the course of his career: he was forced to drink vodka while in Moscow for talks with the Russian Orthodox Church. One Orthodox metropolitan, he said, even insisted that he drink vodka for breakfast\u2014though in that case, Kasper said, the vodka was actually fairly good.\nOn 21 February 2011, he opted for the order of Cardinal-Priest, with his former diaconal church elevated to the level of cardinalitial title.\n[edit] Reconciliation with Jews\nIn 2003, he wrote a text called Anti-semitism: A wound to be healed for the European Day of Jewish Culture.[1] On July 10, 2004, at the Latin-American Rabbinical Seminary of Buenos Aires, the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation and the Angelo Roncalli Committee presented to Cardinal Kasper the \"Memorial Mural Award\", for his lifetime dedication to the causes of understanding and reconciliation between Jews and Catholics.[2]\n[edit] International Theological Commission\n\n\nStyles of\nWalter Kasper\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nRottenburg-Stuttgart (Emeritus)\n\n\nKasper is a member of the International Theological Commission, an advisory body to the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith. Upon the death of John Paul II on 2 April 2005, Kasper and all major Vatican officials, in accord with custom, automatically lost their positions during the sede vacante. He was a cardinal elector in the 2005 papal conclave. On the following 21 April, Pope Benedict XVI confirmed him as President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. He has repeatedly led official delegations of the Vatican on the annual visit to the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople, on the occasion of the patronal feast of Saint Andrew. In August 2007, he was the head of the Roman Catholic delegation that participated at the funeral ceremony of Patriarch Teoctist of the Romanian Christian Orthodox Church.\n[edit] Book on the Eucharist\nIn 2005, Cardinal Kasper wrote a book entitled Sacrament Of Unity: The Eucharist and the Church, a reflection on the Eucharist partly inspired by John Paul II's encyclical Ecclesia de Eucharistia. In this book, he strongly insisted on the sacrificial character of the Eucharist, an aspect somewhat overshadowed after the Council.\n[edit] Book about Jesus Christ\nFirst published in 1976, Cardinal Kasper's book Jesus The Christ treats of the subject of Christology in three manners: A contemporary approach, a historical approach and a factual approach. After these three approaches have been exhausted, the Chrisotlogical themes of resurrection, mystery, and priesthood are treated. Ecclesiology is seen as part of Christology in this book because the Church is oriented towards Christ in his person. And Christ did not only say things, but he also did things.[3]\n[edit] Society of Saint Pius X\nIn January 2009, Kasper told The New York Times that he had little, if any, input on whether to lift the excommunication of four bishops of the Society of Saint Pius X.[4] This action was especially controversial because of the views of one of the bishops regarding the Holocaust, although his views on this matter had nothing to do with the original excommunication: British-born Bishop Richard Williamson had claimed that reports about the Holocaust were exaggerated and that no Jews died in Nazi gas chambers. [1]\nAs the Vatican official responsible for relations with the Jewish religion, Kasper felt it necessary to comment on the action and the process leading up to the lifting of the excommunications. Kasper said that: \"Up to now people in the Vatican have spoken too little with each other and have not checked where problems might arise\". In reference to the lifting of the excommunications, he continued, saying that \"there were misunderstandings and management errors in the Curia.\"\n[edit] Comments on Britain\nIn September 2010, Cardinal Kasper pulled out of the papal visit to Britain, after reportedly saying that Heathrow Airport gives the impression of a Third World country and that the United Kingdom is marked by \"a new and aggressive atheism\".[5] In an interview with German magazine Focus, the cardinal was quoted as saying: \"When you land at Heathrow you think at times you have landed in a Third World country,\" as well as adding criticism of British Airways (BA), a comment not unlike those presented at the Review Centre website, but Kasper's secretary explained it as \"a description of the many different people that live in Britain at the moment\".[6] With regard to British Airways, he said that, when one wears a cross on the airline \"you are discriminated against\", a reference to the British Airways cross controversy. British Airways said that Kasper had been \"seriously misinformed\" in his claims about the airline, and that \"It is completely untrue that we discriminate against Christians or members of any faith\".[5]\nA spokesman for the Church in Britain said that Kasper's remarks were not the views of the Vatican or of the Church.[5] The cardinal's secretary said that Kasper had decided not to travel because of difficulty in walking, because of gout.[6] He also explained the cardinal's reference to \"aggressive atheism\" in Britain as his way of describing people like Richard Dawkins, (a prominent atheist) who have been very critical of the Pope and who had even talked about making a \"citizens arrest\" of the Pope while in Britain.[6]\n[edit] Papal conclave, 2013\nMain article: Papal conclave, 2013\nKasper will likely be the oldest cardinal eligible to vote in the Papal conclave of 2013. According to section 33 of Universi Dominici Gregis, only cardinals \"who have reached their eightieth birthday before the day of the Roman Pontiff's death or the day when the Apostolic See becomes vacant\" do not vote.[7] His 80th birthday will be 5 March 2013.\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Anti-semitism: A wound to be healed\n^ Cardinal Walter Kasper distinguished by the Wallenberg Foundation and the Angelo Roncalli Committee\n^ WALTER KASPER, Jesus the Christ, translated by V.

His father was a United States Army pilot in World War I, and had moved to Torre\u00f3n to run an airline. His mother, Helen, was a convert to Roman Catholicism from Presbyterianism.\nHe attended schools in New York, Florida, Georgia, and Barranquilla, Colombia, before graduating from Charlotte Amalie High School in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.\nHe graduated from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts with a major in medieval history, before beginning philosophy studies at Saint Joseph Seminary College in St. Benedict, Louisiana, from 1953 to 1955, and then theological studies at the Pontifical College Josephinum in Worthington, Ohio, from 1955 to 1961.\nOn May 21, 1961. Law was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Natchez-Jackson in Mississippi. He served two years as an assistant pastor of St. Paul's Catholic Church in Vicksburg, and was made the editor of the Mississippi Register, the diocesan newspaper. He also held several other diocesan posts from 1963 to 1968, including director of the family life bureau and spiritual director of the minor seminary.\n[edit] Civil rights activism\nLaw was a civil rights activist.[1][2] He was a member of the Mississippi Leadership Conference and Mississippi Human Relations Council.[2] For his civil rights activities and his strong positions on civil rights in the Mississippi Register, of which he was editor, he received death threats.[2][3] The newspaper lost many subscribers for whom his civil rights stance was repugnant.[3]\nCharles Evers, activist and brother of Medger Evers (activist assassinated in 1963), praised Law and said he acted \u201cnot for the Negro, but for justice and what is right.\u201d[3]\nLaw's civil rights activity led him to develop ties with Protestant church leaders and he received national attention for his work for ecumenism[3] and in 1968 he was tapped for his first national post, as executive director of the U.S. Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.[3]\n[edit] Bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau\n\nPope Paul VI named him to head the Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau on October 22, 1973, for which he was ordained as a bishop on 5 December 1973. Law's predecessor in Springfield-Cape Girardeau was William Wakefield Baum, another future cardinal.\nIn 1975, he made the news when he arranged for the resettlement in his diocese of one hundred and sixty-six Vietnamese refugees who had arrived in the United States, and who were members of a Vietnamese religious congregation, the Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix.\nIn continuing his ecumenical work, Law formed the Missouri Christian Leadership Conference. He was made a member of the Vatican's Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity and served from 1976 to 1981 as a consultor to its Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews. In the late 1970s, Law would also chair the U.S. bishops' Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.\nIn 1981, Law was named the Vatican delegate to develop and oversee a program instituted by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in which U.S. Episcopal priests would be accepted into the Catholic priesthood. In the program's first year sixty-four Episcopal priests applied for acceptance. This brought married priests with their families into U.S. Roman Catholic dioceses for the first time (Eastern Catholic Churches, in keeping with their own traditions, have ordained married men to the priesthood for centuries).\nIn this period Law was also a pro-life activist and spoke out against abortion. During the 1984 presidential race, when Geraldine Ferraro, who was a Roman Catholic, was the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Law and then Archbishop of New York John Joseph O'Connor both denounced her renunciation of rights for the unborn. Law called abortion \"the critical issue of the moment\".\n[edit] Archbishop of Boston\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Cardinal Bernard Law, with his motto \"To live is Christ\", in front of Santa Susanna.\n\n\n\n\nStyles of\nBernard Francis Law\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nBoston (Emeritus)\n\n\nOn January 11, 1984, Cardinal Law was appointed Archbishop of Boston, by Pope John Paul II. He was installed as Archbishop on March 23, 1984.\nOnly a little over a year later on May 25, 1985, he was elevated in consistory as a member of the College of Cardinals, where he was also appointed the Cardinal-Priest of the Titulus S. Susannae.\nIt was his speech at the 1985 Synod of Bishops marking the 20th anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, that led to development of the Catechism of the Catholic Church in which Law oversaw the first draft of the English translation.\nIn the mid-1980s, Law chaired the bishops' Committee on Pastoral Research and Practices at the time it distributed a major study report on Freemasonry. The bishops' report concluded that \"the principles and basic rituals of Masonry embody a naturalistic religion, active participation in which is incompatible with Christian faith and practice.\"\nIn October 2012, former Irish President (and Catholic) Mary McAleese related that, on a state visit to the United States in 1998, she was publicly berated by Law for her stance on the ordination of women. The cardinal ushered McAleese and members of her delegation into a room to hear Mary Ann Glendon lecture them on the Church's views on women priests and where a heated argument then took place. McAleese rebuked him with the statement that she was \"the President of Ireland and not just of Catholic Ireland\". Cardinals Desmond Connell of Dublin and Cahal Daly of Armagh condemned Law's action.[4]\nIn 1989 and 1990 Law visited Cuba. He met with Fidel Castro in 1990 and in January 1998 he led a delegation of two hundred and forty Bostonians to Cuba during the papal visit there. In 2000 he was part of an inter-American delegation of bishops that met with Castro for more than four hours.\nDuring his time as Archbishop he continued to oppose abortion. However, in 1995, when John Salvi attacked two Boston abortion clinics, he urged a moratorium on clinic protests.\n[edit] Sexual abuse scandal\nMain article: Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston\nCardinal Law's reign as Archbishop of Boston began in popularity but declined into turbulence towards the end of his term. Allegations and reports of sexual misconduct by priests of the Archdiocese of Boston became widespread causing Roman Catholics in other dioceses of the United States to investigate similar situations there. Cardinal Law's actions and inactions prompted public scrutiny of all members of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the steps they had taken in response to past and current allegations of sexual misconduct at the hands of priests. The events in the Archdiocese of Boston exploded into a national Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal.\nUnder questioning, the cardinal stated that, when a priest committed a sex crime, his practice was to seek the analysis of psychiatrists, clinicians and therapists in residential treatment centers before deciding whether to return a priest accused of sexually abusing a child to the pulpit.\nCardinal Law became the first high-level Church official to be accused of actively participating in the cover-up of child molestation.[5]\nThe Archdiocese closed sixty-five parishes before Cardinal Law stepped down from service.\n[edit] Resignation as Archbishop of Boston\nLaw submitted his resignation as Archbishop of Boston to the Vatican, and Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation on December 13, 2002. In 2003, Sean O'Malley, O.F.M. Cap. was named Archbishop of Boston.\nIn a statement and apology, Law said, \"To all those who have suffered from my shortcomings and mistakes I both apologize and from them beg forgiveness.\"[citation needed] He remains a bishop and cardinal, which is a separate appointment. As a cardinal, he participated in the 2005 papal conclave.\n[edit] Move to Rome\n\nIn December 2002, Law left Boston. It is often alleged [6] that he left just hours before state troopers arrived with subpoenas seeking his grand jury testimony; however, he had previously given evidence before two grand juries and been fully investigated by the state attorney general and the five district attorneys in the counties in which the archdiocese operates. When the state attorney general issued his report entitled Child Sexual Abuse in the Archdiocese of Boston (July 23, 2003) he severely criticized Law mentioning that \"the Archdiocese has shown an institutional reluctance to adequately address the problem and, in fact, made choices that allowed the abuse to continue\" but did not allege that Law had tried to evade investigation and he did state that Law had not broken any laws because the law requiring abuse to be reported was not expanded to include priests until 2002.[7]\nIn May 2004, John Paul II appointed Law to a post in Rome, putting him in charge of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, with the title of Archpriest.[8]\nLaw is also a member of the Congregations for the Oriental Churches, the Clergy, Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments, Evangelisation of Peoples, Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, Catholic Education, Bishops as well as the Pontifical Council for the Family. He held membership in all these congregations and of the council before resigning from the governance of the Archdiocese of Boston, and at that time was also a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture.[9]\nLaw reached age 80 on November 4, 2011, and lost the right to participate in any papal conclave and on the same day he ceased to hold his various Curial memberships. He remained as archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore until November 21, 2011, when Archbishop Santos Abril y Castell\u00f3 was appointed as the new archpriest.\n[edit] Retirement\nIt was \"commonly believed that [Law would] live out his retirement in Rome\" when he was retired in 2011.[10]\nIn May 2012, MSNBC reported that Law was \"the person in Rome most forcefully supporting\" the Vatican response to U.S. Archbishop William E. Lori's petition to investigate the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, a large group of American nuns. Other American churchmen in Rome, including Cardinal Raymond Burke and Cardinal James Stafford also reportedly backed the investigation, which was led by former archbishop of San Francisco Cardinal William Levada. In April 2012, \"after a three-year investigation, the Vatican\u2019s doctrine watchdog [had] appointed Archbishop J. Peter Sartain of Seattle to oversee the nuns' organization and reform its programs to adhere more closely to 'the teachings and discipline of the Church'\".[11]\n[edit] See also\n\nRoman Catholic sex abuse cases\nList of the Catholic bishops of the United States#American bishops serving outside the United States\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Pham, John-Peter, Heirs of the Fisherman via books.google.ie.\n^ a b c Boston Globe, 2004, Abuse in the Catholic Church\n^ a b c d e National Catholic Reporter, 27 December 2002\n^ \"Cardinal Law told Mary McAleese he was \u2018sorry for Catholic Ireland to have you as President\", IrishCentral, 7 October 2012\n^ \"irish-priests-followup\", wbur.org, 2010/02/10.\n^ \"bring-the-pope-to-justice\", thedailybeast.com/newsweek, 2010/04/22.\n^ \"ReillyExecSum\", bishop-accountability.org.\n^ \"Cardinal Law Given Post In Rome\", The New York Times, May 28, 2004.

He went to the Vatican in 1996 as President of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers, and was named Archbishop ad personam.\n[edit] Cardinalate\n\n\nCardinal Lozano Barrag\u00e1n at the Basilica of Guadalupe, 2004\n\n\nBishop Lozano Barrag\u00e1n was elevated to Cardinal-Deacon of San Michele Arcangelo by Pope John Paul II on 21 October 2003.\nLozano Barrag\u00e1n was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nOn 18 April 2009, Pope Benedict accepted the resignation of Cardinal Lozano Barrag\u00e1n for reasons of age and appointed Zygmunt Zimowski to the post.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Abortion\nCardinal Barrag\u00e1n has expressed strong opposition to abortion, especially with regards to the RU-486 pill, which has abortive effects on the conceptus.[1]\n[edit] John Paul II\nCardinal Lozano Barrag\u00e1n was among the first to promote the canonization of Pope John Paul II after his death in April 2005, claiming that the 1990 recovery of a boy with terminal leukemia, whom the Pope blessed, is a miracle attributable to John Paul.\n[edit] AIDS and contraception\nMain article: Roman Catholic Church and AIDS\nIn 2006 it was reported that Cardinal Lozano Barrag\u00e1n was preparing a report for Pope Benedict which might state that using condoms is the lesser of two evils when one of the people is infected with AIDS [2] However, the story was later downplayed when the cardinal declared that he did not have the authority to give definitive doctrinal directives. Moreover, in 2009, Pope Benedict XVI argued that the spread of AIDS \"cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it.\" [3]\n[edit] Euthanasia\nCardinal Lozano Barrag\u00e1n has publicly intervened in high-profile euthanasia cases, notably with Terri Schiavo and Eluana Englaro, which he unabashedly described as murders.\n[edit] Homosexuals and transsexuals\nIn December 2009 a website published a statement by Cardinal Lozano Barrag\u00e1n in which he said that, while the Church regarded homosexuality as an insult to God, this did not justify discrimination against gay and transsexual people. The cardinal quoted Saint Paul's Letter to the Romans[4] as indicating that homosexuals and transsexuals will never enter the kingdom of heaven. He later clarified that this did not mean that no individual homosexual can be saved, since existence of grave fault requires not only grave matter but also full knowledge and consent, and since being homosexual is often due not to personal fault but to education and environment.[5] Saying that people are not born homosexual, he attributed homosexuality to reasons such as education and failure to develop one's identity during adolescence.[6]\nHoly See Press Office spokesman Fr Federico Lombardi, S.J. said the website should not be considered an authority on Catholic thinking \"on complex and delicate issues such as homosexuality\". For the teaching of the Catholic Church on the matter, Lombardi referred to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357-2359, which states that, while \"homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered\", those who have homosexual tendencies \"must be accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity\" and \"every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided\".[5]\n[edit] Episcopal Succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nErnesto Corripio Ahumada\n\n\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nRafael Mu\u00f1oz Nu\u00f1ez\nBishop of Zacatecas\n1984\u20131996\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nFernando Mario Ch\u00e1vez Ruvalcaba\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nFiorenzo Angelini\nPresident of Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers\n1997\u20132009\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nZygmunt Zimowski\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n^ Card.

In 1968, he organized the new pastoral department of the Archdiocese of Bogot\u00e1, and from 1970 to 1972, he was Vicar General of the archdiocese. In early 1971, Pope Paul VI appointed him titular archbishop of Boseta and Auxiliary of Bogot\u00e1.[2]\n[edit] CELAM\nIn 1972, L\u00f3pez Trujillo was elected general secretary of the Latin American Episcopal Conference, a post he held until 1984. Well known for his dislike and distrust of the radical social agenda espoused by many Latin American priests and bishops, in this capacity he led the opposition to liberation theology and succeeded in watering down or reversing many of the reforms made in that forum.[3] One of his major accomplishments during that period was to organize the third general conference of Latin American Bishops in 1979, in which Pope John Paul II participated. That same year, he became Archbishop of Medell\u00edn.\n[edit] Cardinal in Rome\n\n\n\n\nArms of Cardinal Lopez Trujillo\n\n\nArchbishop L\u00f3pez Trujillo was named Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prisca by John Paul II in the consistory of 2 February 1983, becoming the youngest cardinal until 1991. He was promoted to the order of Cardinal Bishops on 17 November 2001. In 1990, L\u00f3pez Trujillo was named president of the Pontifical Council for the Family. He assumed the office in 1991 but retained the title of Archbishop emeritus of Medell\u00edn.\n[edit] Positions\nAs president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, L\u00f3pez Trujillo was a highly influential proponent of conservative values, particularly on sexual matters and liberation theology. He advocated abstinence as an effective solution in preventing the spread of HIV. He reaffirmed the Church's teaching that the use of condoms is immoral, and sought to discourage condom use among Catholics by stating that they are ineffective in preventing the transmission of HIV \u2014 a claim that was opposed and ridiculed by eminent scientists and by the World Health Organization.[3]\nHe was also a strong opponent of gay marriage,[4] abortion (a stance that won him much praise and support from groups such as the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children[5]) and embryological research, warning Catholics involved in the creation of embryos as part of IVF treatment for infertility that they would be excommunicated.[3]\n[edit] 2005 conclave\nL\u00f3pez Trujillo participated in the 2005 Papal conclave, which elected Pope Benedict XVI. L\u00f3pez Trujillo was considered as one of the cardinals considered papabile at the 2005 conclave. Upon the death of the pope, all major Vatican officials automatically lost their positions during the sede vacante. Like the others, L\u00f3pez Trujillo was reappointed to his previous office by Pope Benedict XVI on 21 April 2005.[6]\n[edit] Death\nFollowing a four-week hospitalization, Cardinal L\u00f3pez Trujillo died on 19 April 2008 in Rome, aged 72, due to a respiratory infection arising as a complication of diabetes. His funeral Mass was held on 23 April 2008 in St. Peter's Basilica. Cardinal Angelo Sodano was principal celebrant of the Mass, and Pope Benedict XVI delivered the homily and performed the final absolution.[7]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b \"Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo Obituary\".

(May 2010) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Cardinal Marchisano\n\n\nFrancesco Marchisano (born 25 June 1929 in Racconigi, Province of Cuneo) is an Italian Cardinal who has worked in the Roman Curia since 1956. Born in Racconigi, he was ordained a priest in Turin by Cardinal Maurilio Fossati in 1952.\nA period of study in Rome intended to be temporary turned permanent when he was offered his first Curial appointment by Cardinal Giuseppe Pizzardo. Rising through the Vatican dicastery then headed by Cardinal Pizzardo (then the Sacred Congregation for Seminaries and Universities, now the Congregation for Catholic Education), he eventually served as its Undersecretary from 1969 to 1988. He was also advanced to monsignor, becoming a Papal Chamberlain in 1961 and a Prelate of Honour in 1971.\nIn 1988 Pope John Paul II named Monsignor Marchisano to become a bishop, and personally consecrated him on January 6, 1989. Since then he has served as President and Secretary of various Vatican organs, being promoted to archbishop in 1994.\nHis past positions include:\n\nPresident of the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archeology (1991\u20132004)\nPresident of the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church (1993\u20132002)\nPresident of the Artistic-Cultural Commission of the Grand Jubilee Year 2000\n\n\n\nStyles of\nFrancesco Marchisano\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nPopulonia (titular see)\n\n\nIn 2002 he was named to succeed Cardinal Virgilio No\u00e8 as Archpriest of the Patriarchal Vatican Basilica, Vicar General for the State of Vatican City, and President of the Fabric of Saint Peter. This being a position reserved for a Cardinal, Archbishop Marchisano was duly elevated in the next consistory the following year, becoming Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Lucia del Gonfalone. Some months after being additionally appointed President of the Permanent Commission for the Care of the Historical and Artistic Monuments of the Holy See.\nHe passed the normal retirement age of 75 for Curial positions in 2004, though this is frequently waived (Cardinal Noe had remained in office past his 80th birthday). After the death of Cardinal Jan Pieter Schotte, Cardinal Marchisano was named on February 5, 2005, to succeed him as President of the Labour Office of the Apostolic See, retaining his other positions. However, Archbishop Angelo Comastri was named to the unusual position of Coadjutor Archpriest of Saint Peter's. He was also the eventual successor to Cardinal Marchisano's other posts at the Vatican.\nCardinal Marchisano was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. In a funeral Mass for Pope John Paul II celebrated the day after his funeral, Cardinal Marchisano revealed that he had been cured of an illness of the throat after the late pope had prayed and touched him.\nOn 31 October 2006 Pope Benedict named Angelo Comastri to succeed Cardinal Marchisano as Archpriest of St Peter's Basilica.

He holds a doctorate in Canon law and is fluent in Italian, English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.\nAfter finishing his studies, Martino entered the Vatican's diplomatic service in 1962, serving in Nicaragua, the Philippines, Lebanon, Canada, and Brazil.\n[edit] Apostolic Nuncio\nIn 1980, Martino was named apostolic pro-nuncio to Thailand and Singapore and apostolic delegate to Laos and Malaysia and was named Archbishop of the titular see of Segerme. In 1983, he was named apostolic delegate to Brunei Darussalam, while retaining his other posts.\nIn 1986, he was appointed Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations. He was on duty during the United States invasion of Panama, when President Noriega had taken refuge at the Vatican embassy.\nIn 1991, he opposed the American-led invasion of Iraq and was later critical of state sanctions against Iraq. In 1992, he participated at the UN Conference for the environment in Rio de Janeiro, speaking about the centrality of the human person.\nIn June 1994, Martino demanded at the UN that a safe haven be created for Tutsi refugees in Rwanda in order to save over 30 000 lives in Kabgayi.[1]\nArchbishop Martino was Pope John Paul II's official representative at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, and he had the difficult task of defending the Church's pro-life teachings before a European-American bloc that strongly supported abortion on demand. In the end, however, Martino was able to find support from Latin-American and Arab countries that were anti-abortion, and the Cairo conference was ultimately inconclusive.\nLater in 1995, he participated at the World Conference on Women in Beijing, echoing John Paul's positions in his letter to women. He has been on diplomatic mission to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to settle disputes there.\n[edit] President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace\nOn 1 October 2002, Martino was named President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. He became a member of the College of Cardinals in 2003. Martino was named President of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants on March 11, 2006.\nMartino was elevated to the College of Cardinals in the consistory of 21 October 2003 becoming Cardinal-Deacon of S. Francesco di Paola ai Monti. Martino was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nConcerning the case of Terri Schiavo, Martino publicly intervened in order to save Terri, to no avail.[2]\nOn 6 November 2006, after the death sentence had been passed on Saddam Hussein, Martino said that:\n\n...punishing a crime with another crime \u2013 which is what killing for vengeance is \u2013 would mean that we are still at the point of demanding an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth...\n\nHe pleaded for clemency for Hussein and called for a peace conference aimed at solving all the major conflicts in the Middle East and reiterated his position that invasion of Iraq by U.S.-led coalition was wrong.\nCardinal Martino has taken a great interest in automobiles and has proclaimed the Ten Commandments for Drivers. He has collaborated with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile and has condemned activities of Oswald Mosley as immoral.\nOn the topic of genetically modified organisms, he has advocated a cautious use of GMOs, asserting that they may indeed help feed the hungry, although they will most likely not solve all food problems on earth.\nOn 14 June 2007, Martino urged Catholics to withhold donations to Amnesty International in response to the group's decision to advocate in favor of access to abortion in rare cases, which placed Amnesty in conflict with the Catholic view of the human fetus as a rights-holder.\nLater in 2007, he participated in the Annapolis conference on peace in the Holy Land. He has led high-level diplomatic talks between Israelis and Palestinians, and has much experience in Mideast diplomacy. He has represented the Vatican view of moral equivalence and has said that both sides are \"guilty\" and that it is \"necessary to separate them, like two fighting siblings are separated\", and make them \"sit down to negotiate.[3]\nSpeaking on the 2008\u20132009 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict Cardinal Martino said that \"The consequences of egoism are hatred, poverty and injustice. It's always the unarmed populations who pay. Look at the conditions in Gaza \u2013 more and more, it resembles a huge concentration camp.\" [2] In response to this the Israeli government said that Cardinal Martino had swallowed \"'Hamas propaganda\" and invited him to reflect and apologize for what it called his inflammatory message.\n[edit] Retirement\nOn 23 November 2007 at the age of 75, Cardinal Martino sent his resignation to Pope Benedict. On 28 February 2009, Pope Benedict relieved Cardinal Martino of the presidency of the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples and appointed Archbishop Antonio Maria Vegli\u00f2, who had been Secretary of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, to the post. [3] On 24 October 2009, Pope Benedict named as successor to Cardinal Martino as president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace Cardinal Peter Turkson, formerly Archbishop of Cape Coast, Ghana. [4] Cardinal Martino remains a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See and the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State.\nIn July 2010, Cardinal Martino assumed the position of Honorary President of the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, a Rome based organisation established to promote human dignity 'based on the recognition that man is made in the image and likeness of God.' [5]\nIn November 2010 Cardinal Martino was appointed by Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro as Grand Prior of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George. On 8 October 2011, he was named special papal envoy to the celebration of the centenary of the cathedral of Yangon, Burma, programmed for 8 December 2011. Cardinal Martino will meet Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi, a Buddhist, who will be in attendance. Representatives of all religions in Burma, where Catholics represent only around one percent of the population, are being invited to the event, when Martino will read a message from Pope Benedict XVI. The envoy will then have lunch with local clergy and \"special guests\". The pope called on Martino to transmit \"a message of goodwill\" to political and religious authorities in Myanmar, where the military dictatorship has made a number of gestures of greater openness in recent months.[4]\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nSilvio Luoni\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Thailand\n14 September 1980 \u2013 3 December 1986\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nAlberto Tricarico\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nSilvio Luoni\nApostolic Pro-Nuncio to Singapore\n14 September 1980 \u2013 3 December 1986\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nAlberto Tricarico\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nSilvio Luoni\nApostolic Delegate to Laos\n14 September 1980 \u2013 3 December 1986\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nAlberto Tricarico\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nSilvio Luoni\nApostolic Delegate to Malaysia\n14 September 1980 \u2013 3 December 1986\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nAlberto Tricarico\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\n\u2013\nApostolic Delegate to Brunei Darussalam\n1983 \u2013 3 December 1986\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nAdriano Bernardini\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nGiovanni Cheli\nPermanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations\n3 December 1986 \u2013 1 October 2002\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nCelestino Migliore\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nNguyen Van Thuan\nPresident of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace\n1 October 2002 \u2013 24 October 2009\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nPeter Turkson\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nPietro Pavan\nCardinal-Deacon of San Francesco di Paola ai Monti\n21 October 2003 \u2013 incumbent\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nStephen Fumio Hamao\nPresident of the Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples\n11 March 2006 \u2013 28 February 2009\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nAntonio Maria Vegli\u00f2\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\n^ Vatican Asks U.N. for 'Safe Area' in Rwanda\n^ [1]\n^ ZENIT article\n^ Vatican envoy to meet Suu Kyi in Myanmar this week\n\n\nBiography at catholic-pages.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 4658345\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nMartino, Renato\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n23 November 1932\n\n\nPlace of birth\nSalerno, Italy\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 7991/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 34510/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 43234/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 17793/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1734868-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130228041209 ", "Name": "Renato Raffaele Martino"}, {"url": "/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Saraiva_Martins", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0\nJos\u00e9 Saraiva Martins\u00a0C.M.F.\n\n\nPrefect Emeritus of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints\n\n\nAppointed\n30 May 1998\n\n\nReign ended\n9 July 2008\n\n\nPredecessor\nAlberto Bovone\n\n\nSuccessor\nAngelo Amato\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Bishop of Palestrina\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nOrdination\n16 March 1957\nby\u00a0Ettore Cunial\n\n\nConsecration\n2 July 1988\nby\u00a0Agostino Casaroli\n\n\nCreated Cardinal\n21 February 2001\n\n\nRank\nCardinal-Bishop\n\n\nPersonal details\n\n\nBorn\n(1932-01-06)January 6, 1932\nGagos de Jarmelo, Portugal\n\n\nNationality\nPortuguese\n\n\nDenomination\nRoman Catholic\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\n\nTitular Archbishop of Thuburnica (1988-2001)\nSecretary of the Congregation for Catholic Education (1988-1998)\nCardinal-Deacon of Nostra Signora del Sacro Cuore (2001-2009)\n\n\n\n\n\nMotto\nveritas in charitate\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\n\n\n\nStyles of\nJos\u00e9 Saraiva Martins\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nPalestrina (titular see)\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Saraiva Martins, CMF, GCC (born 6 January 1932) is a Portuguese Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He is the Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, having served as prefect from 1998 to 2008.\nBorn in Gagos de Jarmelo in Guarda, Portugal, to Antonio and Maria (n\u00e9e da Natividade Martins) Saraiva, he joined the Congregation of the Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, and professed his vows on 22 August 1950. Martins was ordained as a priest by Archbishop Ettore Cunial on 16 March 1957. He studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) in Rome, where he earned a licentiate and a doctorate (respectively) in theology.\nMartins taught metaphysics for a year in Marino, Italy, then in 1959 came to the Roman Claretianum, where he taught fundamental and sacramental theology for a decade. He became rector of the Pontifical Urbaniana University for three terms (1977\u20131980, 1980\u20131983, 1986\u20131988).\nOn 26 May 1988, he was appointed Secretary of the Curial Congregation for Catholic Education and titular archbishop of Thuburnica. He received his episcopal consecration from Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, with Archbishops Jan Pieter Schotte and Giovanni Battista Re serving as co-consecrators, on the following 2 July in the Basilica of Ss. XII Apostoli. On 30 May 1998, he was named prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, the organisation within the Roman Curia that pronounces judgments on beatifications and canonizations. Saraiva Martins was created Cardinal-Deacon of Nostra Signora del Sacro Cuore by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of February 21, 2001. All major Vatican officials automatically lose their positions during a sede vacante, and the cardinal lost his position on April 2, 2005 on the death of the Pope. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI, who later confirmed him to office (on 21 April 2005). On 8 July 2008, it was announced that he would be succeeded by Angelo Amato. On February 24, 2009, he was promoted to the order of cardinal bishops, with title of the suburbicarian see of Palestrina.[1]\n[edit] External links\n\nBiography at catholic-pages.com\n\n[edit] Sources\n\n\n^ \"Promozione all\u2019Ordine dei Vescovi dell\u2019Em.mo Card.

On Wednesday, January 19, 2011, Cardinal Nicora was named by Pope Benedict XVI as the President of the four-person Executive Board of the Vatican's new Financial Information Authority. The new agency, by mandate of an Apostolic Letter, is charged with monitoring the monetary and commercial activities of Vatican agencies, such as the Governorate of Vatican City State, the Vatican Bank, the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, and smaller agencies such as the Vatican Pharmacy, the Vatican Supermarket, and the Vatican Museums.\n[edit] Biography\nNicora was born in Varese, Italy and ordained a priest in 1964. Prior to being ordained, he had earned a license in Canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome as well as a license in theology from the Theological Faculty in Milan. After his ordination, he became a professor of canon law at the Theological Seminary of Venegano.\nNicora first became a bishop in 1977, when he was appointed auxiliary bishop of Milan and titular bishop of Furnos Minor. Nicora oversaw the 1984 revision of the concordat, between Italy and the Vatican. From 1992 to 1997, he served as bishop of Verona. In 2002, Nicora became President of Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See, where his responsibility was administering the Vatican's income from properties. This position is comparable to that of a chief financial officer in a corporation. Upon the death of a Pope all major Vatican officials automatically lose their positions during a sede vacante, and so Nicora lost his position on 2 April 2005 due to the death of Pope John Paul II but later was confirmed to office by Pope Benedict XVI on 21 April.\n\n\nStyles of\nAttilio Nicora\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nNicora was proclaimed a Cardinal-Deacon of San Filippo Neri in Eurosia in 2003 by Pope John Paul II.

However, this did not happen; Tarcisio Bertone became the new Secretary of State.\nPope Benedict XVI appointed Cardinal Nicora Pontifical Legate for the Basilicas of St. Francis and of St. Mary of the Angels in Assisi, without prejudice to his functions as head of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See.\n[edit] External links\n\nBio from ewtn.com\nEntry on a blog discussing Nicora's chances of becoming Pope\nAn interview with Nicora\nBlog entry discussing Nicora as likely nominee for Secretary of State\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAgostino Cacciavillan\nPresident of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See\n1 October 2002\u20137 July 2011\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nDomenico Calcagno\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nNone\nPresident of the Financial Information Authority\n19 January 2011\u2013present\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nIncumbent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 7516851\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nNicora\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n16 March 1937\n\n\nPlace of birth\nVarese, Italy\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6460/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 33934/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 31563/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 11240/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:3574586-0!*!0!!*!4!* and timestamp 20130228045104 ", "Name": "Attilio Nicora"}, {"url": "/wiki/Mario_Francesco_Pompedda", "FullText": "Carlo Mario Francesco Pompedda JUD (18 April 1929 \u2013 18 October 2006) was an Italian cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church and the Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura for the Roman Curia. He spent nearly fifty years in a variety of posts within the Catholic Church's ecclesiastical court system, from 1955 to 2004.\n[edit] Biography\n\n\n\n\nCoat of Arms of Cardinal Pompedda\n\n\nPompedda was born in Ozieri in Sardinia. He studied at seminaries in Sassari and Cuglieri and was ordained a priest in Rome on 23 December 1951. He obtained a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University, and a doctorate in utroque iure (in civil law and canon law) from the Pontifical Lateran University. He became an officer of the Roman Rota, the general appellate court of the Catholic Church, in 1955, serving as a defender of the bond. He joined the tribunal as an auditor in 1969 and served in that capacity until he became Dean of the Roman Rota in 1993. He was appointed Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the highest tribunal in the church, in 1999. He resigned this position, as is customary, upon reaching the age of 75, on 18 April 2004, and his resignation was accepted on 27 May 2004.\nPompedda was appointed titular Archbishop of Bisarcio on 29 November 1997 and ordained as such on 6 February 1998. He was proclaimed a Cardinal-Deacon of Santissima Annunciazione della Beata Vergine Maria a Via Ardeatina by Pope John Paul II on 21 February 2001. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. It was suspected that he may have been the source of information about the conclave published in the Italian journalist Lucio Brunelli in the journal Limes in September 2005; many also suspected that the information was false.\n\n\nStyles of\nMario Francesco Pompedda\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nBisarcio (titular)\n\n\nCardinal Pompedda also served as president of the appellate court of Vatican City and, from 1999, as president of the Court of Cassation of Vatican City. He is credited with drafting Universi Dominici Gregis.\nPompedda taught canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was also involved in the revision of the code of canon law in 1983, the first substantial revision since 1917. He was also the principal editor of Universi Dominici Gregis, the apostolic constitution of Pope John Paul II published in 1995, which set the rules for the sede vacante and papal conclave. He supported proposals to make it easier to obtain an annulment of marriage, and gave several public lectures in 2003 outlining the changes. He retired before the changes were implemented, and the final document, Dignitas connubii, did not go as far he had expected, reaffirming existing doctrine instead.\nPompedda was appointed as the Cardinal Grand Prior of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George by order of the Grand Master, HRH The Duke of Castro. In November 2003, he became the Ecclesiastical Counsellor of the Order by appointment of Pope John Paul II. This position continued under Pope Benedict XVI.\nCardinal Pompedda died in Rome of a brain hemorrhage. He will be buried in a tomb in the cathedral in Ozieri.\nOn 18 February 2010, his remains were reinterred in a specially constructed sarcophagus in the cathedral of Ozieri at the chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament. The requiem mass was celebrated at 5 p.m., presided by Bishop Sergio Pintor of Ozieri. At the end of the mass, Mgr Giuseppe Sciacca, judge of the Roman Rota and a long time collaborator of Cardinal Pompedda, read a special message sent for the occasion by Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone, S.D.B., secretary of State, in the name of Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] References\n\nBio from ewtn.com\nCardinals of the Holy Roman Church\nNews article about Pompedda's resignation, 28 May 2004\nObituary, The Times, 3 November 2006\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nZenon Grocholewski\nPrefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura\n15 November 1999\u201327 May 2004\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nAgostino Vallini\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 89687566\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nPompedda, Mario Francesco\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n18 April 1929\n\n\nPlace of birth\n\n\n\nDate of death\n18 October 2006\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 2672/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 25292/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 10532/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 1972/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 12/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1757158-0!*!0!!*!4!* and timestamp 20130226112938 ", "Name": "Mario Francesco Pompedda"}, {"url": "/wiki/Paul_Poupard", "FullText": "Paul Joseph Jean Poupard (born 30 August 1930 in Bouzill\u00e9, Maine-et-Loire) is a French Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church who has been President of the Pontifical Council for Culture and also of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue.

Heavily influenced by his pastor, to whom Poupard credits his vocation, he studied at the minor seminary in Beaupr\u00e9au, University of Angers, and \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes of the Sorbonne (from where he obtained his doctorates in theology and history). Poupard was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Stanislas Courbe on 18 December 1954, and then taught at the Mongazon School. After entering the French section of the Secretariat of State in 1959, he was raised to the rank of Chaplain of His Holiness on 20 March 1965, and of Honorary Prelate of His Holiness on 29 November 1971. Poupard was Rector of the Institut Catholique de Paris from 1972 to 1980, and also served as Vice-President of the Society of French Ecclesiastical History.\nOn 2 February 1979, he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Paris and Titular Bishop of Usula. Poupard received his episcopal consecration on the following 6 April from Cardinal Fran\u00e7ois Marty, with Archbishop Andr\u00e9 Pailler and Bishop Jean Orchampt serving as co-consecrators, in the Church of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. A year and a half later, in 1980, he received a position in the Roman Curia, the Holy See's governing body, as Pro-President of the Secretariat for Non-Believers, later (in 1988) renamed the Pontifical Council for Culture. In 1985, his title was changed to President, on his becoming Cardinal-Deacon of S. Eugenio. After the sede vacante period that followed the death of Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI immediately reappointed him to the same position and on 11 March 2006 also named him President of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue.\nPoupard has been interested in the relationships between faith and reason, Church and state, and science and religion from an early age. He is an accomplished scholar and author. Some of his writings have been translated into languages including Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, Croatian, English, German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. He holds doctorates in theology and history from the Sorbonne, as well as honorary doctorates from at the Universities of Aix-en-Provence, Fu Jen, Louvain, Kyoto, Santiago de Chile, Puebla de los Angeles and the Babes-Bolyai University/Cluj-Napoca.\nIn 1996 he was appointed Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prassede. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nIn September 2007 he was replaced as President of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue by Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran and as President of the Pontifical Council for Culture by Gianfranco Ravasi, at that time Prefect of the Ambrosian Library.\n[edit] External links\n\nBio\nThe text of a speech given by Cardinal Poupard, June 27, 2001\nPontifical Council for Culture Homepage of the Dicastery presided over by Cardinal Poupard\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nGabriel-Marie Garrone\nPresident of the Pontifical Council for Culture\n19 April 1988\u20133 September 2007\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nGianfranco Ravasi\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nMichael L.

Benedict XVI was elected on 19 April 2005 in a papal conclave, celebrated his Papal Inauguration Mass on 24\u00a0April 2005, and took possession of his cathedral, the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, on 7 May 2005. A native of Bavaria, he has both German and Vatican citizenship.\nOrdained as a priest in 1951, Ratzinger established himself as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958. After a long career as an academic, serving as a professor of theology at several German universities\u2014the last being the University of Regensburg, where he served as Vice President of the university 1976\u20131977\u2014he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he settled in Rome when he became Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until his election as Pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals, and as such the primus inter pares among the cardinals. Prior to becoming Pope, he was \"a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century\" as \"one of the most respected, influential and controversial members of the College of Cardinals\"; he had an influence \"second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions\" as one of Pope John Paul II's closest confidants.[3]\nHe was originally a liberal theologian, but adopted conservative views after 1968.[4] His prolific[5] writings defend traditional Catholic doctrine and values. During his papacy, Benedict XVI has advocated a return to fundamental Christian values to counter the increased secularisation of many Western countries. He views relativism's denial of objective truth, and the denial of moral truths in particular, as the central problem of the 21st century. He teaches the importance of both the Catholic Church and an understanding of God's redemptive love. He has reaffirmed the \"importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work.\"[6] Pope Benedict has also revived a number of traditions including elevating the Tridentine Mass to a more prominent position.[7] He has renewed the relationship between the Catholic Church and art, viewing the use of beauty as a path to the sacred,[8] promoted the use of Latin,[9] and reintroduced traditional papal garments, for which reason he has been called \"the pope of aesthetics\".[10] Several of Pope Benedict's students from his academic career are also prominent churchmen today and confidantes of him, notably Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn.[11][12]\nOn 11 February 2013, Pope Benedict announced his pending resignation, effective 28 February 2013, because of \"lack of strength of mind and body\".[13] He will become the first pope to resign since Pope Gregory XII in 1415, and the first to do so voluntarily since Pope Celestine V in 1294.[14][15][16] Pope Benedict XVI is expected to move into the newly renovated Mater Ecclesiae monastery for his retirement.[17][18] He will retain the name of Benedict XVI, the style of His Holiness, and the title of Pope, continue to dress in the papal colour of white, and be commonly referred to as the Pope Emeritus.[19]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Overview\n2 Early life: 1927\u201351\n3 Pre-papal career\n\n3.1 Academic career: 1951\u201377\n3.2 Archbishop of Munich and Freising: 1977\u201382\n3.3 Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: 1981\u20132005\n\n\n4 Papacy 2005\u2013present\n\n4.1 Election to the papacy\n4.2 Choice of name\n4.3 Tone of papacy\n\n4.3.1 Beatifications\n4.3.2 Canonizations\n4.3.3 Doctors of the Church\n\n\n4.4 Curia reform\n4.5 Teachings\n\n4.5.1 \"Friendship with Jesus Christ\"\n4.5.2 \"Dictatorship of Relativism\"\n4.5.3 Christianity as religion according to reason\n4.5.4 Encyclicals\n4.5.5 Post-synodal apostolic exhortation\n4.5.6 Motu proprio on Tridentine Mass\n4.5.7 Unicity and salvific universality of the Catholic Church\n4.5.8 Consumerism\n\n\n4.6 Ecumenical efforts\n4.7 Dialogue with other religions\n\n4.7.1 Judaism\n4.7.2 Islam\n4.7.3 Tibetan Buddhism\n4.7.4 Indigenous American beliefs\n4.7.5 International Society for Krishna Consciousness\n\n\n4.8 Apostolic ministry\n4.9 Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church\n4.10 Attire\n4.11 Health\n4.12 Resignation\n\n4.12.1 Indications\n\n\n\n\n5 Titles and styles\n6 Positions on moral and political issues\n\n6.1 Birth control and HIV/AIDS\n6.2 Homosexuality\n\n6.2.1 Same-sex marriage\n\n\n6.3 International relations\n\n6.3.1 Migrants and refugees\n6.3.2 China\n6.3.3 Korea\n6.3.4 Turkey\n6.3.5 Israel\n6.3.6 Vietnam\n\n\n6.4 Global economy\n6.5 Nuclear energy\n\n\n7 Interests\n8 Honours and awards\n9 Arms\n10 Writings\n11 See also\n12 Notes\n13 References\n14 Further reading\n\n14.1 Literature about him\n14.2 Biographies\n14.3 Documentaries\n\n\n15 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Overview\n\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI at a private audience on 20 January 2006\n\n\nBenedict XVI was elected Pope at the age of 78. He is the oldest person to have been elected Pope since Pope Clement XII (1730\u201340). He had served longer as a cardinal than any Pope since Benedict XIII (1724\u201330). He is the ninth German Pope, the eighth having been the Dutch-German Pope Adrian VI (1522\u201323) from Utrecht. The last Pope named Benedict was Benedict XV, an Italian who reigned from 1914 to 1922, during World War I (1914\u201318).\nBorn in 1927 in Marktl, Bavaria, Germany, Ratzinger had a distinguished career as a university theologian before being appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising by Pope Paul VI (1963\u201378). Shortly afterwards, he was made a cardinal in the consistory of 27 June 1977. He was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith by Pope John Paul II in 1981 and was also assigned the honorific title of the cardinal bishop of Velletri-Segni on 5 April 1993. In 1998, he was elected sub-dean of the College of Cardinals. On 30\u00a0November 2002, he was elected dean, taking, as is customary, the title of cardinal bishop of the suburbicarian diocese of Ostia. He was the first Dean of the College elected Pope since Paul IV (1555\u201359) and the first cardinal bishop elected Pope since Pius VIII (1829\u201330).\nEven before becoming Pope, Ratzinger was one of the most influential men in the Roman Curia, and was a close associate of John Paul II. As Dean of the College of Cardinals, he presided over the funeral of John Paul II and over the Mass immediately preceding the 2005 conclave in which he was elected. During the service, he called on the assembled cardinals to hold fast to the doctrine of the faith. He was the public face of the church in the sede vacante period, although, technically, he ranked below the Camerlengo in administrative authority during that time. Like his predecessor, Benedict XVI affirms traditional Catholic doctrine.\nIn addition to his native German, Benedict speaks French and Italian fluently. He also has a very good command of Latin and speaks English and Spanish adequately. Furthermore, he has some knowledge of Portuguese. He can read Ancient Greek and biblical Hebrew.[20][broken citation] He has stated that his first foreign language is French. He is a member of several scientific academies, such as the French Acad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques. He plays the piano and has a preference for Mozart and Bach.[21]\n[edit] Early life: 1927\u201351\nMain article: Early life of Pope Benedict XVI\nMain article: Ratzinger family\n\n\n\n\nThe house where Ratzinger was born, in Marktl, Bavaria, Germany. The building still stands today.\n\n\nJoseph Aloisius Ratzinger was born on 16 April, Holy Saturday, 1927, at Schulstra\u00dfe 11, at 8:30 in the morning in his parents' home in Marktl, Bavaria, Germany. He was baptised the same day. He was the third and youngest child of Joseph Ratzinger, Sr., a police officer, and Maria Ratzinger (n\u00e9e Peintner). His mother's family was originally from South Tyrol (now in Italy),[22] and possibly had Jewish ancestry.[23] Pope Benedict XVI's brother, Georg Ratzinger, a priest and former director of the Regensburger Domspatzen choir, is still alive. His sister, Maria Ratzinger, who never married, managed Cardinal Ratzinger's household until her death in 1991. Their grand-uncle was the German politician Georg Ratzinger.\nAt the age of five, Ratzinger was in a group of children who welcomed the visiting Cardinal Archbishop of Munich with flowers. Struck by the cardinal's distinctive garb, he later announced the very same day that he wanted to be a cardinal.\nRatzinger attended the elementary school in Aschau am Inn, which was renamed in his honour in 2009.[24]\nFollowing his 14th birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was conscripted into the Hitler Youth\u2014as membership was required by law for all 14-year-old German boys after December 1939[25]\u2014but was an unenthusiastic member who refused to attend meetings, according to his brother.[26] In 1941, one of Ratzinger's cousins, a 14-year-old boy with Down syndrome, was taken away by the Nazi regime and murdered during the Action T4 campaign of Nazi eugenics.[27] In 1943, while still in seminary, he was drafted into the German anti-aircraft corps as Luftwaffenhelfer (air force child soldier).[26] Ratzinger then trained in the German infantry.[28] As the Allied front drew closer to his post in 1945, he deserted back to his family's home in Traunstein after his unit had ceased to exist, just as American troops established their headquarters in the Ratzinger household.[29] As a German soldier, he was put in a POW camp but was released a few months later at the end of the war in May 1945.[29] He reentered the seminary, along with his brother Georg, in November.\nThus, following repatriation in 1945, the two brothers entered Saint Michael Seminary in Traunstein, later studying at the Ducal Georgianum (Herzogliches Georgianum) of the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich. They were both ordained in Freising on 29 June 1951 by Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber of Munich. Ratzinger recalled:\n\n...at the moment the elderly Archbishop laid his hands on me, a little bird \u2013 perhaps a lark \u2013 flew up from the altar in the high cathedral and trilled a little joyful song.[30]\n\nRatzinger's 1953 dissertation was on St. Augustine and was titled The People and the House of God in Augustine's Doctrine of the Church. His Habilitation (which qualified him for a professorship) was on Bonaventure. It was completed in 1957 and he became a professor of Freising College in 1958.\n[edit] Pre-papal career\n[edit] Academic career: 1951\u201377\nRatzinger became a professor at the University of Bonn in 1959; his inaugural lecture was on \"The God of Faith and the God of Philosophy\". In 1963, he moved to the University of M\u00fcnster.\nDuring this period, Ratzinger participated in the Second Vatican Council (1962\u201365). Ratzinger served as a peritus (theological consultant) to Cardinal Frings of Cologne. He was viewed during the time of the Council as a reformer, cooperating with theologians like Hans K\u00fcng and Edward Schillebeeckx. Ratzinger became an admirer of Karl Rahner, a well-known academic theologian of the Nouvelle Th\u00e9ologie and a proponent of church reform.\nIn 1966, Ratzinger was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at the University of T\u00fcbingen, where he was a colleague of Hans K\u00fcng. In his 1968 book Introduction to Christianity, he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of T\u00fcbingen and the Marxist leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalised, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. Ratzinger came increasingly to see these and associated developments (such as decreasing respect for authority among his students) as connected to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings.[31] Despite his reformist bent, his views increasingly came to contrast with the liberal ideas gaining currency in theological circles.[32]\nSome voices, among them Hans K\u00fcng, deem this a turn towards conservatism, while Ratzinger himself said in a 1993 interview, \"I see no break in my views as a theologian [over the years]\".[33] Ratzinger has continued to defend the work of the Second Vatican Council, including Nostra Aetate, the document on respect of other religions, ecumenism and the declaration of the right to freedom of religion. Later, as the Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger most clearly spelled out the Catholic Church's position on other religions in the 2000 document Dominus Iesus which also talks about the Roman Catholic way to engage in \"ecumenical dialogue\".\nDuring his years at T\u00fcbingen University, Ratzinger published articles in the reformist theological journal Concilium, though he increasingly chose less reformist themes than other contributors to the magazine such as Hans K\u00fcng and Edward Schillebeeckx.\nIn 1969, he returned to Bavaria, to the University of Regensburg. He founded the theological journal Communio, with Hans Urs von Balthasar, Henri de Lubac, Walter Kasper and others, in 1972. Communio, now published in seventeen languages, including German, English and Spanish, has become a prominent journal of contemporary Catholic theological thought. Until his election as Pope, he remained one of the journal's most prolific contributors. In 1976, he suggested that the Augsburg Confession might possibly be recognised as a Catholic statement of faith.[34][35]\nSeveral of Pope Benedict's students from his academic career are also prominent churchmen today and confidantes of him, notably Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn, and a number of his former students sometimes meet for discussions.[11][12]\nHe served as Vice President of the University of Regensburg from 1976 to 1977.[36]\n\n\nOrdination History\n\n\nDiaconal ordination\n\n\nOrdained by\nJohannes Baptist Neuh\u00e4usler\n\n\nDate of ordination\n29 October 1950\n\n\nPriestly ordination\n\n\nOrdained by\nMichael Cardinal von Faulhaber\n\n\nDate of ordination\n29 June 1951\n\n\nEpiscopal consecration\n\n\nPrincipal consecrator\nJosef Stangl\n\n\nCo-consecrator\nRudolf Graber\n\n\nCo-consecrator\nErnst Tewes\n\n\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n28 May 1977\n\n\nBishops consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI as principal consecrator\n\n\nAlberto Bovone\n12 May 1984\n\n\nZygmunt Zimowski\n25 May 2002\n\n\nJosef Clemens\n6 January 2004\n\n\nBruno Forte\n8 September 2004\n\n\nMieczys\u0142aw Mokrzycki\n29 September 2007\n\n\nFrancesco Giovanni Brugnaro\n29 September 2007\n\n\nGianfranco Ravasi\n29 September 2007\n\n\nTommaso Caputo\n29 September 2007\n\n\nSergio Pagano\n29 September 2007\n\n\nVincenzo Di Mauro\n29 September 2007\n\n\nGabriele Giordano Caccia\n12 September 2009\n\n\nFranco Coppola\n12 September 2009\n\n\nPietro Parolin\n12 September 2009\n\n\nRaffaello Martinelli\n12 September 2009\n\n\nGiorgio Corbellini\n12 September 2009\n\n\nSavio Hon Tai-Fai\n5 February 2011\n\n\nMarcello Bartolucci\n5 February 2011\n\n\nCelso Morga Iruzubieta\n5 February 2011\n\n\nAntonio Guido Filipazzi\n5 February 2011\n\n\nEdgar Pe\u00f1a Parra\n5 February 2011\n\n\n[edit] Archbishop of Munich and Freising: 1977\u201382\n\n\n\n\nPalais Holnstein in Munich, the residence of Benedict as Archbishop of Munich and Freising\n\n\nOn 24 March 1977, Ratzinger was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising. He took as his episcopal motto Cooperatores Veritatis (Co-workers of the Truth) from 3\u00a0John 8, a choice he comments upon in his autobiographical work, Milestones. In the consistory of the following 27 June, he was named Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria Consolatrice al Tiburtino by Pope Paul VI. By the time of the 2005 Conclave, he was one of only 14 remaining cardinals appointed by Paul VI, and one of only three of those under the age of 80. Of these, only he and William Wakefield Baum took part in the conclave.[37]\n[edit] Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: 1981\u20132005\nMain article: Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith\nOn 25 November 1981, Pope John Paul II named Ratzinger as the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, formerly known as the \"Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office\", the historical Roman Inquisition. Consequently, he resigned his post at Munich in early 1982. He was promoted within the College of Cardinals to become Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni in 1993 and was made the college's vice-dean in 1998 and dean in 2002. Just a year after its foundation in 1990 Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger joined the European Academy of Sciences and Arts in Salzburg/Austria in 1991.[38][39]\nRatzinger defended and reaffirmed Catholic doctrine, including teaching on topics such as birth control, homosexuality, and inter-religious dialogue. The theologian Leonardo Boff, for example, was suspended, while others were censured. Other issues also prompted condemnations or revocations of rights to teach: for instance, some posthumous writings of Jesuit priest Anthony de Mello were the subject of a notification. Ratzinger and the congregation viewed many of them, particularly the later works, as having an element of religious indifferentism (i.e., Christ was \"one master alongside others\"). In particular, Dominus Iesus, published by the congregation in the jubilee year 2000, reaffirmed many recently \"unpopular\" ideas, including the Catholic Church's position that \"Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.\" The document angered many Protestant churches by claiming that they are not actually churches, but \"ecclesial communities\".[40]\nRatzinger's 2001 letter De delictis gravioribus clarified the confidentiality of internal church investigations, as defined in the 1962 document Crimen Sollicitationis, into accusations made against priests of certain crimes, including sexual abuse. This became a target of controversy during the sex abuse scandal.[41] As a Cardinal, Ratzinger had been for twenty years the man in charge of enforcing the document.[42] While bishops hold the secrecy pertained only internally, and did not preclude investigation by civil law enforcement, the letter was often seen as promoting a coverup.[43] Later, as Pope, he was accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to cover up the molestation of three boys in Texas, but sought and obtained diplomatic immunity from prosecution.[44]\nOn 12 March 1983, Ratzinger, as prefect, notified the lay faithful and the clergy that archbishop Pierre Martin Ngo Dinh Thuc had incurred excommunication latae sententiae for illicit episcopal consecrations without the apostolic mandate.\nIn 1997, when he turned 70, Ratzinger asked Pope John Paul II for permission to leave the Congregation of the Doctrine of Faith and to become an archivist in the Vatican Secret Archives and a librarian in the Vatican Library, but the pope refused such permission.[45][46]\n[edit] Papacy 2005\u2013present\n\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI in\u00a0St.\u00a0Peter's\u00a0Square, Rome\n\n\n[edit] Election to the papacy\nMain article: Papal conclave, 2005\nOn 2 January 2005, Time magazine quoted unnamed Vatican sources as saying that Ratzinger was a front runner to succeed John Paul II should the pope die or become too ill to continue as pope. On the death of John Paul II, the Financial Times gave the odds of Ratzinger becoming pope as 7\u20131, the lead position, but close to his rivals on the liberal wing of the church. In April 2005, before his election as pope, he was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time. While Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the Bavarian village of Pentling near Regensburg and dedicate himself to writing books.\nThough Ratzinger was increasingly considered the front runner by much of the international media, others maintained that his election was far from certain, since very few papal predictions in modern history had come true. The elections of both John Paul II and his predecessor, John Paul I had been rather unexpected. Despite being the favorite (or perhaps because he was the favorite), it was a surprise to many that he was actually elected, as traditionally the frontrunners are passed over by the conclave for someone else.\nOn 19 April 2005, Ratzinger was elected as the successor to Pope John Paul II on the second day of the papal conclave after four ballots. Ratzinger had hoped to retire peacefully and said that \"At a certain point, I prayed to God 'please don't do this to me'...Evidently, this time He didn't listen to me.\"[47] Coincidentally, 19 April is the feast of St. Leo IX, the most important German pope of the Middle Ages, known for instituting major reforms during his pontificate.\nBefore his first appearance at the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica after becoming pope, he was announced by Jorge Medina Est\u00e9vez, Cardinal Protodeacon of the Holy Roman Church. Cardinal Medina Est\u00e9vez first addressed the massive crowd as \"dear(est) brothers and sisters\" in Italian, Spanish, French, German and English, with each language receiving cheers from the international crowd, before continuing with the traditional Habemus Papam announcement in Latin.\nAt the balcony, Benedict's first words to the crowd, given in Italian before he gave the traditional Urbi et Orbi blessing in Latin, were:\n\n\n\u201c\nDear brothers and sisters, after the great Pope John Paul II, the Cardinals have elected me, a simple, humble labourer in the vineyard of the Lord. The fact that the Lord knows how to work and to act even with insufficient instruments comforts me, and above all I entrust myself to your prayers. In the joy of the Risen Lord, confident of his unfailing help, let us move forward. The Lord will help us, and Mary, His Most Holy Mother, will be on our side. Thank you.[48]\n\u201d\n\n\nOn 24 April, he celebrated the Papal Inauguration Mass in St. Peter's Square, during which he was invested with the Pallium and the Ring of the Fisherman. Then, on 7 May, he took possession of his cathedral church, the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran.\n[edit] Choice of name\nRatzinger chose the pontifical name Benedict, which comes from the Latin word meaning \"the blessed\", in honour of both Pope Benedict XV and Saint Benedict of Nursia. Pope Benedict XV was Pope during the First World War, during which time he passionately pursued peace between the warring nations. St. Benedict of Nursia was the founder of the Benedictine monasteries (most monasteries of the Middle Ages were of the Benedictine order) and the author of the Rule of Saint Benedict, which is still the most influential writing regarding the monastic life of Western Christianity.\nThe pope explained his choice of name during his first General Audience in St. Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005:\n\n\n\u201c\nFilled with sentiments of awe and thanksgiving, I wish to speak of why I chose the name Benedict. Firstly, I remember Pope Benedict XV, that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war. In his footsteps I place my ministry in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples. Additionally, I recall Saint Benedict of Nursia, co-patron of Europe, whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe. I ask him to help us all to hold firm to the centrality of Christ in our Christian life: May Christ always take first place in our thoughts and actions![49]\n\u201d\n\n\n[edit] Tone of papacy\n\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI's first trip in a Popemobile\n\n\nDuring his inaugural Mass, the previous custom of every cardinal submitting to the Pope was replaced by having twelve people, including cardinals, clergy, religious, a married couple and their child, and newly confirmed people, greet him. (The cardinals had formally sworn their obedience upon his election.) He began using an open-topped papal car, saying that he wanted to be closer to the people. Pope Benedict has continued the tradition of his predecessor John Paul II and baptises several infants in the Sistine Chapel at the beginning of each year, in his pastoral role as Bishop of Rome.\n[edit] Beatifications\nOn 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Normally, five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict, Camillo Ruini, Vicar General of the Diocese of Rome and the official responsible for promoting the cause for canonization of any person who dies within that diocese, cited \"exceptional circumstances\" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived. This happened before, when Pope Paul VI waived the five-year rule and announced beatification processes for his predecessors, Pope Pius XII and Pope John XXIII. Benedict XVI followed this precedent when he waived the five-year rule for John Paul II.[50] The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima and the 24th anniversary of the attempt on John Paul II's life.[51] John Paul II often credited Our Lady of F\u00e1tima for preserving him on that day. Cardinal Ruini inaugurated the diocesan phase of the cause for beatification in the Lateran Basilica on 28 June 2005.[52]\nThe first beatification under the new Pope was celebrated on 14 May 2005, by Jos\u00e9 Cardinal Saraiva Martins, Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The new Blesseds were Mother Marianne Cope and Mother Ascensi\u00f3n Nicol Go\u00f1i. Cardinal Clemens August Graf von Galen was beatified on 9 October 2005. Mariano de la Mata was beatified in November 2006 and Rosa Eluvathingal was beatified 3 December of that year, and Fr. Basil Moreau was beatified September 2007.[53] In October 2008 the following beatifications took place: Celestine of the Mother of God, Giuseppina Nicoli, Hendrina Stenmanns, Maria Rosa Flesch, Marta Anna Wiecka, Michael Sopocko, Petrus Kibe Kasui and 187 Companions, Susana Paz-Castillo Ramirez, Maria Isbael Salvat Romero, and John Henry Newman.\nUnlike his predecessor, Benedict XVI delegated the beatification liturgical service to a Cardinal. On 29 September 2005, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued a communiqu\u00e9 announcing that henceforth beatifications would be celebrated by a representative of the Pope, usually the Prefect of that Congregation.[54]\n[edit] Canonizations\n\n\n\n\nPope Benedict at the canonization of Frei Galv\u00e3o\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI celebrated his first canonizations on 23 October 2005 in St. Peter's Square when he canonized Josef Bilczewski, Alberto Hurtado SJ, Zygmunt Gorazdowski, Gaetano Catanoso, and Felice da Nicosia. The canonizations were part of a Mass that marked the conclusion of the General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops and the Year of the Eucharist.[55] Pope Benedict XVI canonized Bishop Rafael Guizar y Valencia, Mother Theodore Guerin, Filippo Smaldone, and Rosa Venerini on 15 October 2006.\nDuring his visit to Brazil in 2007, Pope Benedict XVI presided over the canonization of Frei Galv\u00e3o on 11 May, while George Preca, founder of the Malta based M.U.S.E.U.M., Szymon of Lipnica, Charles of Mount Argus, and Marie-Eug\u00e9nie de J\u00e9sus were canonized in a ceremony held at the Vatican on 3 June 2007.[56] Preca is the first Maltese saint since the country's conversion to Christianity in 60 A.D. when St. Paul converted the inhabitants.[57] In October 2008 the following canonizations took place: Saint Alphonsa of India,[58] Gaetano Errico, Narcisa de Jesus Martillo Moran, Maria Bernarda B\u00fctler. In April 2009 he canonized Arcangelo Tadini, Bernardo Tolomei, Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira, Geltrude Comensoli, Caterina Volpicelli.[59] In October of the same year he canonized Jeanne Jugan, Jozef Damian de Veuster, Zygmunt Szcz\u0119sny Feli\u0144ski, Francisco Coll Guitart and Rafael Arn\u00e1iz Bar\u00f3n.[60][61]\nOn 17 October 2010, Pope Benedict XVI formally declared sainthood for Saint Andr\u00e9 Bessette, a French-Canadian; Stanislaw Soltys, a 15th-century Polish priest; Italian nuns Giulia Salzano and Camilla Battista da Varano; Spanish nun Candida Maria de Jesus Cipitria y Barriola and the first Australian saint, Mother Mary MacKillop.[62]\nOn 23 October 2011, Pope Benedict XVI canonized three saints: a Spanish nun Bonifacia Rodriguez y Castro, Italian archbishop Guido Maria Conforti, and Italian priest Luigi Guanella.[63]\nIn December 2011, Pope Benedict formally recognized the validity of the miracles necessary to proceed with the canonizations of Kateri Tekakwitha, who would be the first Native American saint, Marianne Cope, a nun working with lepers in what is now the state of Hawaii, Giovanni Battista Piamarta, an Italian priest, Jacques Berthieu a French Jesuit priest and African martyr, Carmen Salles y Barangueras, a Spanish nun and founder of the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, Peter Calungsod, a lay catechist and martyr from the Philippines, and Anna Schaffer whose desire to be a missionary was unfulfilled on account of her illness.[64] They were canonized on 21 October 2012.[65]\n[edit] Doctors of the Church\nOn 7 October 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named Hildegard of Bingen and John of Avila Doctors of the Church, the 34th and 35th individuals so recognised in the history of Christianity.[66]\n[edit] Curia reform\n\n\n\nThe Holy See\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of the series:\nPolitics and government of\nthe Holy See\n\n\n\n\nThe Roman Pontiff\n\n\nBenedict XVI\nConclave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege of Cardinals\n\n\nDean of the College of Cardinals\nCamerlengo of the Holy Roman Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecretariat of State\n\n\nCardinal Secretary of State\nSecretary for Relations with States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongregations\n\n\nDoctrine of the Faith\nOriental Churches\nDivine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments\nCauses of Saints\nBishops\nEvangelization of Peoples\nClergy\nReligious\nCatholic Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTribunals\n\n\nApostolic Signatura\nRoman Rota\nApostolic Penitentiary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPontifical Councils\n\n\nLaity\nPromoting Christian Unity\nFamily\nJustice and Peace\n\"Cor Unum\"\nPastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People\nPastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers\nLegislative Texts\nInterreligious Dialogue\nCulture\nSocial Communications\nPromoting the New Evangelisation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative Services\n\n\nApostolic Camera\nAdministration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See\nPrefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstitutes\n\n\nPrefecture of the Papal Household\nLiturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign relations\n\n\nStatus in international law\n\nLateran Treaty\n\n\nAt the United Nations\nMultilateral foreign policy\nConcordats\nDiplomatic missions\nNuncios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanon law\n\n\n1983 Code of Canon Law\nApostolic Constitution Pastor Bonus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther countries\nAtlas\n\n Politics portal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nt\ne\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Benedict began downsizing the Roman Curia when he merged four existing pontifical councils into two in March 2006. The Pontifical Council for Migrants was merged with the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace headed by Cardinal Martino. Likewise, Cardinal Poupard, who headed the Pontifical Council for Culture, now also oversees the operations of what had been the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, though both Councils maintained separate officials and staffs while their status and competencies continued unchanged. In May 2007 it was decided that Interreligious Dialogue would again become a separate body under a different President. In June 2010 Benedict created the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation. He appointed Archbishop Salvatore Fisichella as its first president.\n[edit] Teachings\nSee also: Theology of Pope Benedict XVI\nAs Pope, one of Benedict XVI's main roles is to teach about the Catholic faith and the solutions to the problems of discerning and living the faith,[67] a role that he can play well as a former head of the Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The main points of emphasis of his teachings are stated in more detail in Theology of Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] \"Friendship with Jesus Christ\"\nAt the conclusion of his first homily as Pope, Benedict referred to both Jesus Christ and John Paul II. Citing John Paul II's well-known words, \"Do not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ!\", Benedict XVI said:\n\n\n\u201c\nAre we not perhaps all afraid in some way? If we let Christ enter fully into our lives, if we open ourselves totally to Him, are we not afraid that He might take something away from us?...And once again the Pope said: No! If we let Christ into our lives, we lose nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of what makes life free, beautiful and great. No! Only in this friendship do we experience beauty and liberation....When we give ourselves to Him, we receive a hundredfold in return. Yes, open, open wide the doors to Christ\u00a0\u2013 and you will find true life.[68]\n\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenedict XVI: \"The Eucharist is the enduring presence of Jesus' self-oblation.\" (Deus Caritas Est)\n\n\n\"Friendship with Jesus Christ\" is a frequent theme of his preaching.[69][70] He stressed that on this intimate friendship, \"everything depends.\"[71] He has also said: \"We are all called to open ourselves to this friendship with God... speaking to him as to a friend, the only One who can make the world both good and happy... That is all we have to do is put ourselves at his disposal...is an extremely important message. It is a message that helps to overcome what can be considered the great temptation of our time: the claim, that after the Big Bang, God withdrew from history.\"[72] Thus, in his book Jesus of Nazareth, his main purpose was \"to help foster [in the reader] the growth of a living relationship\" with Jesus Christ.[71]\nHe took up this theme in his first encyclical Deus Caritas Est. In his personal explanation and summary of the encyclical, he stated: \"If friendship with God becomes for us something ever more important and decisive, then we will begin to love those whom God loves and who are in need of us. God wants us to be friends of his friends and we can be so, if we are interiorly close to them.\"[73] Thus, he said that prayer is \"urgently needed...It is time to reaffirm the importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work.\"\n[edit] \"Dictatorship of Relativism\"\nContinuing what he said in the pre-conclave Mass about what he has often referred to as the \"central problem of our faith today\",[74] on 6 June 2005 Pope Benedict also said:\n\n\n\u201c\nToday, a particularly insidious obstacle to the task of education is the massive presence in our society and culture of that relativism which, recognising nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires. And under the semblance of freedom it becomes a prison for each one, for it separates people from one another, locking each person into his or her own ego.[75]\n\u201d\n\n\nHe said that \"a dictatorship of relativism\"[76] was the core challenge facing the church and humanity. At the root of this problem, he said, is Kant's \"self-limitation of reason\". This, he said, is contradictory to the modern acclamation of science whose excellence is based on the power of reason to know the truth. He said that this self-amputation of reason leads to pathologies of religion such as terrorism and pathologies of science such as ecological disasters.[77] Benedict traced the failed revolutions and violent ideologies of the 20th century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides. He said \"Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called totalitarianism.\"[78]\nIn an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at the basilica of St. John Lateran 6 June 2005, Benedict remarked on the issues of same sex marriage and abortion:\n\nThe various forms of the dissolution of matrimony today, like free unions, trial marriages and going up to pseudo-matrimonies by people of the same sex, are rather expressions of an anarchic freedom that wrongly passes for true freedom of man...from here it becomes all the more clear how contrary it is to human love, to the profound vocation of man and woman, to systematically close their union to the gift of life, and even worse to suppress or tamper with the life that is born.[79]\n\n[edit] Christianity as religion according to reason\nIn the discussion with secularism and rationalism, one of Benedict's basic ideas can be found in his address on the \"Crisis of Culture\" in the West, a day before Pope John Paul II died, when he referred to Christianity as the Religion of the Logos (the Greek for \"word\", \"reason\", \"meaning\", or \"intelligence\"). He said:\n\n\n\u201c\nFrom the beginning, Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the Logos, as the religion according to reason...It has always defined men, all men without distinction, as creatures and images of God, proclaiming for them...the same dignity. In this connection, the Enlightenment is of Christian origin and it is no accident that it was born precisely and exclusively in the realm of the Christian faith....It was and is the merit of the Enlightenment to have again proposed these original values of Christianity and of having given back to reason its own voice... Today, this should be precisely [Christianity's] philosophical strength, in so far as the problem is whether the world comes from the irrational, and reason is not other than a 'sub-product,' on occasion even harmful of its development\u2014or whether the world comes from reason, and is, as a consequence, its criterion and goal...In the so necessary dialogue between secularists and Catholics, we Christians must be very careful to remain faithful to this fundamental line: to live a faith that comes from the Logos, from creative reason, and that, because of this, is also open to all that is truly rational.[80]\n\u201d\n\n\nBenedict also emphasised that \"Only creative reason, which in the crucified God is manifested as love, can really show us the way.\"\n[edit] Encyclicals\nPope Benedict has to date written three encyclicals: Deus Caritas Est (Latin for \"God is Love\"), Spe Salvi (\"Saved by Hope\"), and Caritas in Veritate (\"Love in Truth\").\nIn his first encyclical, Deus Caritas Est, he said that a human being, created in the image of God who is love, is able to practice love: to give himself to God and others (agape), by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation. This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as Teresa of Calcutta and the Blessed Virgin Mary, and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them in Jesus Christ.[81]\nThe encyclical contains almost 16,000 words in 42 paragraphs. The first half is said to have been written by Benedict in German, his mother tongue, in the summer of 2005; the second half is derived from uncompleted writings left by his predecessor, Pope John Paul II.[82] The document was signed by Pope Benedict on Christmas Day, 25 December 2005.[83] The encyclical was promulgated a month later in Latin and was translated into English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. It is the first encyclical to be published since the Vatican decided to assert copyright in the official writings of the Pope.[84]\nPope Benedict's second encyclical titled Spe Salvi (\"Saved by Hope\"), about the virtue of hope, was released on 30 November 2007.[85][86]\nBenedict's third encyclical titled Caritas in Veritate (\"Love in Truth\" or \"Charity in Truth\"), was signed on 29 June 2009 (the Feast of Sts. Peter and Paul) and released on 7 July 2009.[87] In it, the Pope continued the Church's teachings on social justice. He condemned the prevalent economic system \"where the pernicious effects of sin are evident,\" and called on people to rediscover ethics in business and economic relations.[87]\n[edit] Post-synodal apostolic exhortation\nSacramentum Caritatis (The Sacrament of Charity) signed 22 February 2007, released in Latin, Italian, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Polish. It was made available in various languages 13 March 2007 in Rome. The English edition from Libera Editrice Vaticana is 158 pages. This apostolic exhortation \"seeks to take up the richness and variety of the reflections and proposals which emerged from the Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops...\" which was held in 2006.[88]\n[edit] Motu proprio on Tridentine Mass\nSee also: Summorum Pontificum\n\n\n\n\nA pre-1969 Latin Rite altar with reredos.\nThe high altar of a church was usually preceded by three steps, below which were said the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. Side altars usually had only one step.\n\n\nOn 7 July 2007, Benedict XVI issued the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, declaring that upon \"the request of the faithful\", celebration of Mass according to the Missal of 1962 (commonly known as the Tridentine Mass), was to be more easily permitted. Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass may now merely request permission from their local priest.[89] While Summorum Pontificum directs that pastors should provide the Tridentine Mass upon the requests of the faithful, it also allows for any qualified priest to offer private celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, to which the faithful may be admitted if they wish.[90] For regularly scheduled public celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, the permission of the priest in charge of the church is required.[91]\nIn an accompanying letter, the Pope outlined his position concerning questions about the new guidelines.[90] As there were fears that the move would entail a reversal of the Second Vatican Council,[92] Benedict emphasised that the Tridentine Mass would not detract from the Council, and that the Mass of Paul VI would still be the norm and priests were not permitted to refuse to say the Mass in that form. He pointed out that use of Tridentine Mass \"was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted.\"[90] The letter also decried \"deformations of the liturgy ... because in many places celebrations were not faithful to the prescriptions of the new Missal\" as the Second Vatican Council was wrongly seen \"as authorising or even requiring creativity\", mentioning his own experience.[90]\nThe Pope considered that allowing the Tridentine Mass to those who request it was a means to prevent or heal schism, stating that, on occasions in history, \"not enough was done by the Church\u2019s leaders to maintain or regain reconciliation and unity\" and that this \"imposes an obligation on us today: to make every effort to enable for all those who truly desire unity to remain in that unity or to attain it anew.\"[90] Many feel the decree aimed at ending the schism between the Holy See and traditionalist groups such as the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX). Cardinal Dar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos, the president of the Pontifical Commission established for the purpose of facilitating full ecclesial communion of those associated with that Society,[93] stated that the decree \"opened the door for their return\". Bishop Bernard Fellay, superior general of the SSPX, expressed \"deep gratitude to the Sovereign Pontiff for this great spiritual benefit\".[89]\n[edit] Unicity and salvific universality of the Catholic Church\nNear the end of June 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document approved by Benedict XVI \"because some contemporary theological interpretations of Vatican II's ecumenical intent had been 'erroneous or ambiguous' and had prompted confusion and doubt.\"[94] The document has been seen as restating \"key sections of a 2000 text the pope wrote when he was prefect of the congregation, Dominus Iesus.\"[94]\n[edit] Consumerism\nBenedict XVI has condemned excessive consumerism, especially among youth. He stated in December 2007 that \"[A]dolescents, youths and even children are easy victims of the corruption of love, deceived by unscrupulous adults who, lying to themselves and to them, draw them into the dead-end streets of consumerism.\"[95]\nIn June 2009, he blamed outsourcing for greater availability of consumer goods which lead to downsizing of social security systems.[96]\n[edit] Ecumenical efforts\nMain article: Pope Benedict XVI and Ecumenism\nSpeaking at his weekly audience in St Peter's Square on 7 June 2006, Pope Benedict asserted that Jesus himself had entrusted the leadership of the Church to his apostle Peter. \"Peter's responsibility thus consists of guaranteeing the communion with Christ,\" said Pope Benedict. \"Let us pray so that the primacy of Peter, entrusted to poor human beings, may always be exercised in this original sense desired by the Lord, so that it will be increasingly recognised in its true meaning by brothers who are still not in communion with us.\"\nAlso in 2006, Benedict met with Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual head of the Anglican Communion. In their Common Declaration, they highlighted the previous 40 years of dialogue between Catholics and Anglicans while also acknowledging \"serious obstacles to our ecumenical progress\".[97]\nBenedict has also acknowledged the Lutheran church, saying that he has had friends in that organisation.\n[edit] Dialogue with other religions\nPope Benedict is open to dialogue with other religious groups, and has sought to improve relations with them throughout his pontificate.[98][99] He has, however, generated certain controversies in doing so.\n[edit] Judaism\nMain article: Pope Benedict XVI and Judaism\nWhen Benedict ascended to the Papacy his election was welcomed by the Anti-Defamation League who noted \"his great sensitivity to Jewish history and the Holocaust\".[100] However, his election received a more reserved response from the United Kingdom's Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, who hoped that Benedict would \"continue along the path of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II in working to enhance relations with the Jewish people and the State of Israel.\"[101] The Foreign Minister of Israel also offered more tentative praise, though the Minister believed that \"this Pope, considering his historical experience, will be especially committed to an uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism.\"[101]\nCritics have accused Benedict's papacy of insensitivity towards Judaism. The two most prominent instances were the expansion of the use of the Tridentine Mass and the lifting of the excommunication on four bishops from the Society of St. Pius X (SSPX). In the Good Friday service, the traditional Mass rubrics include a prayer that asks God to lift the veil so they [Jews] may be delivered from their darkness. This prayer has historically been contentious in Judaic-Catholic relations and several groups saw the restoration of the Tridentine Mass as problematic.[102][103][104][105][106] Among those whose excommunications were lifted was Bishop Richard Williamson, an outspoken historical revisionist sometimes interpreted as a Holocaust denier.[107][108][109][110] The lifting of his excommunication led critics to charge that the Pope was condoning his historical revisionist views.[111]\n[edit] Islam\nMain article: Pope Benedict XVI and Islam\nPope Benedict's relations with Islam have been strained at times. On 12 September 2006 Pope Benedict XVI delivered a lecture which touched on Islam at the University of Regensburg in Germany. The pope had previously served as professor of theology at the university, and his lecture was entitled \"Faith, Reason and the University\u2014Memories and Reflections\". The lecture received much attention from political and religious authorities. Many Islamic politicians and religious leaders registered their protest against what they said was an insulting mischaracterisation of Islam, although his focus was aimed towards the rationality of religious violence, and its effect on the religion.[112][113] Muslims were particularly offended by the following quotation from the Pope's speech:\n\n\n\u201c\nShow me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.[113]\n\u201d\n\n\nThe passage originally appeared in the Dialogue Held with a Certain Persian, the Worthy Mouterizes, in Anakara of Galatia[114][115] written in 1391 as an expression of the views of the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus, one of the last Christian rulers before the Fall of Constantinople to the Muslim Ottoman Empire, on such issues as forced conversion, holy war, and the relationship between faith and reason. According to the German text, the Pope's original comment was that the emperor \"addresses his interlocutor in an astoundingly harsh\u2014to us surprisingly harsh\u2014way\" (wendet er sich in erstaunlich schroffer, uns \u00fcberraschend schroffer Form).[116] Pope Benedict apologised for any offence he had caused and made a point of visiting Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country, and praying in its Blue Mosque.\nPope Benedict XVI planned on 5 March 2008, to meet with Muslim scholars and religious leaders autumn 2008 at a Catholic-Muslim seminar in Rome.[117] That meeting, the \"First Meeting of the Catholic-Muslim Forum,\" was held from 4\u20136 November 2008.[118]\nOn 9 May 2009 H.H. Pope Benedict XVI visited the King Hussein Mosque, Amman, Jordan where he was addressed by H.R.H. Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad bin Talal.[98]\n[edit] Tibetan Buddhism\nThe Dalai Lama congratulated Pope Benedict XVI upon his election,[119] and visited him in October 2006 in the Vatican City. In 2007 China was accused of using its political influence to stop a meeting between the Pope and the Dalai Lama.[120]\n[edit] Indigenous American beliefs\nWhile visiting Brazil in May 2007, \"the pope sparked controversy by saying that native populations had been 'silently longing' for the Christian faith brought to South America by colonizers.\"[121] The Pope continued, stating that \"the proclamation of Jesus and of his Gospel did not at any point involve an alienation of the pre-Columbus cultures, nor was it the imposition of a foreign culture.\"[121] President of Venezuela Hugo Ch\u00e1vez demanded an apology, and an indigenous organisation in Ecuador issued a response which stated that \"representatives of the Catholic Church of those times, with honourable exceptions, were accomplices, deceivers and beneficiaries of one of the most horrific genocides of all humanity.\"[121] Later, the pope, speaking Italian, said at a weekly audience that it was:\n\n\"not possible to forget the suffering and the injustices inflicted by colonizers against the indigenous population, whose fundamental human rights were often trampled.\"[122]\n\n[edit] International Society for Krishna Consciousness\nWhile visiting the United States on 17 April 2008, Benedict met with International Society for Krishna Consciousness representative Radhika Ramana Dasa;[123] a notable Hindu scholar[124] and disciple of Hanumatpreshaka Swami.[125] On behalf of the Hindu American community, Radhika Ramana Dasa presented a gift of an Om symbol to Benedict.[126][127]\n[edit] Apostolic ministry\nMain article: List of journeys of Pope Benedict XVI\n\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI in a Mercedes-Benz popemobile in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\n\n\nAs Pontiff, Benedict XVI carries out numerous Apostolic activities including journeys across the world and in the Vatican.\nBenedict travelled extensively during the first three years of his papacy. In addition to his travels within Italy, Pope Benedict XVI has made two visits to his homeland, Germany, one for World Youth Day and another to visit the towns of his childhood. He has also visited Poland and Spain, where he was enthusiastically received.[128] His visit to Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim nation, was initially overshadowed by the controversy about a lecture he had given at Regensburg. His visit was met by nationalist and Islamic protesters[129] and was placed under unprecedented security measures.[130] However, the trip went ahead and Benedict made a joint declaration with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I in an attempt to begin to heal the rift between the Catholic and Orthodox churches.\nIn 2007, Pope Benedict visited Brazil in order to address the Bishops' Conference there and canonize Friar Ant\u00f4nio Galv\u00e3o, an 18th century Franciscan. In June 2007, Benedict made a personal pilgrimage and pastoral visit to Assisi, the birthplace of St. Francis. In September, Benedict undertook a three-day visit to Austria,[131] during which he joined Vienna's Chief Rabbi, Paul Chaim Eisenberg, in a memorial to the 65,000 Viennese Jews who perished in Nazi death camps.[132] During his stay in Austria, he also celebrated Mass at the Marian shrine Mariazell and visited Heiligenkreuz Abbey.[133]\n\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI celebrates his 81st birthday with U.S. President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura. The White House, Washington D.C.\n\n\nIn April 2008, Pope Benedict XVI made his first visit to the United States since becoming pope.[134] He arrived in Washington, DC where he was formally received at the White House and met privately with U.S. President George W. Bush.[135] While in Washington, the pope addressed representatives of US Catholic universities, met with leaders of other world religions, and celebrated Mass at the Washington Nationals' baseball stadium with 47,000 people.[136] The Pope also met privately with victims of sexual abuse by priests. The pope travelled to New York where he addressed the United Nations General Assembly.[137] Also while in New York, the pope celebrated Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, met with disabled children and their families, and attended an event for Catholic youth, where he addressed some 25,000 young people in attendance.[138] On the final day of the pope's visit, he visited the World Trade Center site and later celebrated Mass at Yankee Stadium.[139]\nIn July 2008, the Pope travelled to Australia to attend World Youth Day 2008 in Sydney. On 19 July, in St. Mary's Cathedral, he made an apology for child sex abuse perpetrated by the clergy in Australia.[140][141] On 13 September 2008, at an outdoor Paris Mass attended by 250,000 people, Pope Benedict XVI condemned the modern materialism \u2013 the world's love of power, possessions and money as a modern-day plague, comparing it to paganism.[142][143]\nIn 2009, he visited Africa (Cameroon and Angola) for the first time as a Pope. During his visit, he suggested that altering sexual behavior was the answer to Africa's AIDS crisis, and urged Catholics to reach out and convert believers in sorcery.\nHe visited the Middle East (Jordan, Israel and Palestine) in May 2009.\nPope Benedict's main arena for pastoral activity is the Vatican itself, his Christmas and Easter homilies and Urbi et Orbi are delivered from St Peter's Basilica. The Vatican is also the only regular place where the Pope travels via motor without the protective bulletproof case common to most popemobiles. Despite the more secure setting Pope Benedict has been victim to security risks several times inside Vatican City. On Wednesday, 6 June 2007 during his General Audience a man leapt across a barrier, evaded guards and nearly mounted the Pope's vehicle, although he was stopped and Benedict seemed to be unaware of the event. On Thursday, 24 December 2009, while Pope Benedict was proceeding to the altar to celebrate Christmas Eve Mass at St Peter's Basilica, a woman later identified as 25-year-old Susanna Maiolo, who holds Italian and Swiss citizenships, jumped the barrier and grabbed the pope by his vestments and pulled him to the ground. The 82-year-old fell but was assisted to his feet and he continued to proceed towards the altar to celebrate Mass. Roger Etchegaray, 87, the vice-dean of the College of Cardinals, fell also and suffered a hip fracture. Italian police reported that the woman had previously attempted to accost the Pope at the previous Christmas Eve Mass, but was prevented from doing so.[144][145]\n\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI in Balzan, Malta.\n\n\nIn his homily, Pope Benedict forgave Susanna Maiolo[146] and urged the world to \"wake up\" from selfishness and petty affairs, and find time for God and spiritual matters.[144]\nBetween 17 and 18 April, Pope Benedict made an Apostolic Journey to the Republic of Malta. Following meetings with various dignitaries on his first day on the island, 50,000 people gathered in a drizzle for Papal Mass on the granaries in Floriana. The Pope also met with the Maltese youth at the Valletta Waterfront, where an estimated 10,000 young people turned up to greet him.[147] During his visit the Pope was moved to tears while expressing his shame at cases of abuse on the island during a 20-minute meeting with victims.[148]\n[edit] Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church\nSee also: Catholic sex abuse cases\nPrior to 2001, the primary responsibility for investigating allegations of sexual abuse and disciplining perpetrators rested with the individual dioceses. In 2001, Ratzinger convinced John Paul II to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in charge of all investigations and policies surrounding sexual abuse in order to combat such abuse more efficiently.[149][150] According to John L. Allen, Jr., Ratzinger in the following years \"acquired a familiarity with the contours of the problem that virtually no other figure in the Catholic Church can claim\" and \"driven by that encounter with what he would later refer to as 'filth' in the Church, Ratzinger seems to have undergone something of a 'conversion experience' throughout 2003\u201304. From that point forward, he and his staff seemed driven by a convert's zeal to clean up the mess\".[151] In his role as Head of the CDF, he \"led important changes made in Church law: the inclusion in canon law of internet offences against children, the extension of child abuse offences to include the sexual abuse of all under 18, the case by case waiving of the statute of limitation and the establishment of a fast-track dismissal from the clerical state for offenders.\"[152] As the Head of the CDF, Ratzinger developed a reputation for handling these cases. According to Charles J. Scicluna, a former prosecutor handling sexual abuse cases, \"Cardinal Ratzinger displayed great wisdom and firmness in handling those cases, also demonstrating great courage in facing some of the most difficult and thorny cases, sine acceptione personarum (without exceptions)\".[151][153]\nOne of the cases Ratzinger pursued involved Father Marcial Maciel Degollado, a Mexican priest and founder of the Legion of Christ, who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse. Biographer Andrea Tornielli suggested that Cardinal Ratzinger had wanted to take action against Marcial Maciel Degollado, but that John Paul II and other high-ranking officials, including several cardinals and notably the pope's influential secretary Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, prevented him from doing so.[150][154] According to Jason Berry, Angelo Sodano \"pressured\" Cardinal Ratzinger, who was \"operating on the assumption that the charges were not justified\", to halt the proceedings against Maciel in 1999[155] When Maciel was honored by the Pope in 2004, new accusers came forward[155] and Cardinal Ratzinger \"took it on himself to authorize an investigation of Maciel\"[150] After Ratzinger became pope he began proceedings against Maciel and the Legion of Christ that forced Maciel out of active service in the Church.[149] On 1 May 2010 the Vatican issued a statement denouncing Maciel's \"very serious and objectively immoral acts\", which were \"confirmed by incontrovertible testimonies\" and represent \"true crimes and manifest a life without scruples or authentic religious sentiment.\" Pope Benedict also said he would appoint a special commission to examine the Legionaries\u2019 constitution and open an investigation into its lay affiliate Regnum Christi.[156] Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn explained that Ratzinger \"made entirely clear efforts not to cover things up but to tackle and investigate them. This was not always met with approval in the Vatican\".[149][157] According to Sch\u00f6nborn, Cardinal Ratzinger had pressed John Paul II to investigate Hans Hermann Gro\u00ebr, an Austrian cardinal and friend of John Paul accused of sexual abuse, resulting in Gro\u00ebr's resignation.[154]\nIn March 2010, the Pope sent a Pastoral Letter to the Catholic Church in Ireland addressing cases of sexual abuse by Catholic priests to minors, expressing sorrow, and promising changes in the way accusations of abuse are dealt with.[158] Victim groups claim the letter failed to clarify if secular law enforcement has priority over canon law confidentiality pertaining to internal investigation of abuse allegations.[159][160][161][162] The Pope then promised to introduce measures that would 'safeguard young people in the future' and 'bring to justice' priests who were responsible for abuse.[148] In April, the Vatican issued guidelines on how existing Church law should be implemented. The guideline dictates that \"Civil law concerning reporting of crimes... should always be followed.\"[163] The guideline was intended to follow the norms established by U.S. bishops, but it does not require the reporting of \"allegations\" or crimes where reporting is not required by law.[164]\n[edit] Attire\nMain article: Ceremonial of Benedict XVI\n\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI in choir dress with the red summer papal mozzetta, embroidered red stole, and the red papal shoes.\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI has re-introduced several papal garments which had previously fallen into disuse. Pope Benedict XVI resumed the use of the traditional red papal shoes, which had been used since Roman times by popes but which had fallen into disuse during the pontificate of Pope John Paul II. Contrary to the initial speculation of the press that the shoes had been made by the Italian fashion house Prada, the Vatican announced that the shoes were provided by the pope's personal shoemaker.[165]\nOn 21 December 2005, the pope once only wore the camauro, the traditional red papal hat usually worn in the winter. It had not been seen since the pontificate of Pope John XXIII (1958\u20131963). On 6 September 2006 the pope began wearing the red cappello romano (also called a saturno), a wide-brimmed hat for outdoor use. Rarely used by John Paul II, it was more widely worn by his predecessors.\nCharlotte Allen describes Benedict as \"the pope of aesthetics\": \"He has reminded a world that looks increasingly ugly and debased that there is such a thing as the beautiful\u2014whether it's embodied in a sonata or an altarpiece or an embroidered cope or the cut of a cassock\u2014and that earthly beauty ultimately communicates a beauty that is beyond earthly things.\"[10]\n[edit] Health\nPrior to his election as Pope in 2005, Ratzinger had hoped to retire\u2014on account of age-related health problems, a long-held desire to have free time to write, and the retirement age for bishops (75)\u2014and submitted his resignation as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith three times, but continued at his post in obedience to the wishes of Pope John Paul II. In September 1991, Ratzinger suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily but he recovered completely.[166] This was never officially made public\u2014the official news was that Ratzinger had fallen and struck his head against a radiator\u2014but was an open secret known to the Conclave that elected him Pope.[167]\nSince his election in April 2005 there were several rumors about the Pope's health, but none of them was confirmed. Early in his pontificate Benedict XVI predicted a short reign, which led to concerns about his health.[168] In May 2005 the Vatican announced that he had suffered another mild stroke. French Cardinal Philippe Barbarin said that since the first stroke Ratzinger had been suffering from an age-related heart condition, for which he was on medication. In late November 2006 Vatican insiders told the international press that the Pope had had a routine examination of the heart.[167] A few days later an unconfirmed rumor emerged that Pope Benedict had undergone an operation in preparation for an eventual bypass operation, but this rumor was only published by a small left-wing Italian newspaper and was never confirmed by any Vatican insider.[169]\nOn 17 July 2009 Benedict was hospitalized after falling and breaking his right wrist while on vacation in the Alps; his injuries were reported to be minor.[170]\nFollowing the announcement of his resignation, the Vatican revealed that Pope Benedict had been fitted with a pacemaker while he was still a cardinal, before his election as pope in 2005. The battery in the pacemaker had been replaced three months earlier, a routine procedure, but that did not influence the decision.[171]\n[edit] Resignation\nMain article: Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI\nOn 11 February 2013, the Vatican confirmed Pope Benedict would resign the papacy on 28 February 2013 as a result of his advanced age, becoming the first pope to resign since Gregory XII in 1415.[172] The move was considered unexpected.[173] In modern times, all popes have stayed in office until death. Benedict will be the first Pope to have resigned without external pressure since Pope Celestine V in 1294.[15]\nIn a statement, Benedict cited his deteriorating strength and the physical and mental demands of the papacy;[174] addressing his Cardinals in Latin, Benedict gave a brief statement announcing his resignation. He also declared that he would continue to serve the church \"through a life dedicated to prayer\".[174]\nAccording to a statement from the Vatican, the timing of the resignation was not caused by any specific illness but was to \"avoid that exhausting rush of Easter engagements\".[175] According to the Vatican spokesperson Federico Lombardi Pope Benedict XVI will leave Vatican City after his resignation for the papal summer residence of Castel Gandolfo. After its adaption he will reside at the monastery Mater Ecclesiae located in the Vatican Gardens.[176]\nA papal conclave is not expected to begin until the resignation takes effect on 28 February, with Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi saying he expects the conclave will only take between two and three weeks to conclude, allowing a new Pope to be in place before Easter.[15]\n[edit] Indications\nPaul Collins has suggested[177] that the elevation of the Pope's personal assistant, Georg G\u00e4nswein, to Archbishop in early December 2012 (he was ordained as Bishop on 6 January 2013) was an indication of the impending resignation of Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Titles and styles\n\n\nPapal styles of\nPope Benedict XVI\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Holiness\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Holiness\n\n\nReligious style\nHoly Father\n\n\nThe official style of the Pope is His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI; in Latin, Benedictus XVI, Episcopus Romae.\nHowever, his rarely used full title is: His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman province, Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City, Servant of the Servants of God.\nBefore 1 March 2006, the list of titles also used to contain that of a \"Patriarch of the West\", which traditionally appeared in that list of titles before \"Primate of Italy\". The title of \"Patriarch of the West\" was first adopted in the year 642 by Pope Theodore I, but was rarely used since the East-West Schism of 1054. From the Orthodox perspective, authority in the Church could be traced to the five patriarchates of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem. However, some Catholic theologians have argued that the term \"Patriarch of the West\" has no clear historical or theological basis and was introduced into the papal court in 1870 at the time of the First Vatican Council. Pope Benedict chose to remove the title at a time when discussions with the Orthodox churches have centered on the issue of papal primacy.[citation needed]\nAfter his resignation, he will be known as His Holiness Benedict XVI, Pope emeritus.[178]\n[edit] Positions on moral and political issues\n[edit] Birth control and HIV/AIDS\nIn 2005, the Pope listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms.[179] The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms to protect against the spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John Paul II's consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS.[180] However, the Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church's teaching can occur.[181] TIME also reported in its 30 April 2006 edition that the Vatican's position remains what it always has been with Vatican officials \"flatly dismiss[ing] reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use.\"[181]\nIn March 2009, the Pope stated:\n\n\n\nI would say that this problem of AIDS cannot be overcome merely with money, necessary though it is. If there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, that is to say a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.[182]\n\n\n\nIn November 2010, in a book-length interview, the Pope, using the example of male prostitutes, stated that the use of condoms, with the intention of reducing the risk of HIV infection, may be an indication that the prostitute is intending to reduce the evil connected with his or her immoral activity.[183] In the same interview, the Pope also reiterated the traditional teaching of the Church that condoms are not seen as a \"real or moral solution\" to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Further, in December 2010, the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith explained that the Pope's statement did not constitute a legitimization of either prostitution or contraception, both of which remain gravely immoral.[183]\n[edit] Homosexuality\nDuring his time as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), Benedict XVI made several efforts to tackle the issue of homosexuality within the Church and the wider world. In 1986 the CDF sent a letter to all bishops entitled: On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons. The letter condemned a liberal interpretation of the earlier CDF document Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics, which had led to a \"benign\" attitude \"to the homosexual condition itself\". On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons clarified that the Church's position on homosexuality was that \"although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.\"[184] However the document also condemned homophobic attacks and violence, stating that \"It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs.\"[184]\nIn 1992 he again approved CDF documents declaring that homosexual \"inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder\" and extended this principle to civil law. \"Sexual orientation\", the document said, was not equivalent to race or ethnicity, and it declared that it was \"not unjust discrimination to take sexual orientation into account.\"[185]\nOn 22 December 2008, the Pope gave an end of year message to the Roman Curia in which he talked about gender and the important distinction between men and women. The pope said that the church viewed the distinction as central to human nature, and \"asks that this order, set down by creation, be respected\". He characterised gender roles which deviated from his view of what gender roles should be as \"a violation of the natural order\". The church, he said, \"should protect man from the destruction of himself\". He said a sort of ecology of man was needed, adding: \"The tropical forests do deserve our protection; but man, as a creature, does not deserve any less.\" He attacked what he described as gender theories which \"lead towards the self-emancipation of man from creation and the creator\".[186][187]\nLGBT groups such as the Italian Arcigay and German LSVD have announced that they found the Pope's comments homophobic.[188] Aurelio Mancuso, head of Arcigay, saying \"A divine programme for men and women is out of line with nature, where the roles are not so clear.\"[186]\nFather Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, claimed the Pope had not wished specifically to attack homosexuality, and had not mentioned gays or lesbians in his text. Father Lombardi insisted, however, that there had been an overreaction to the Pope's remarks. \"He was speaking more generally about gender theories which overlook the fundamental difference in creation between men and women and focus instead on cultural conditioning.\" Nevertheless, the remarks were interpreted as a call to save mankind from homosexuals and transsexuals.[186]\n[edit] Same-sex marriage\nDuring a 2012 Christmas speech,[189] the Pope made remarks about the present-day interpretation of the notion of \"gender\". He stated that \"sex is no longer a given element of nature, that man has to accept and personally make sense of: it is a social role that we choose for ourselves\", and \"The words of the creation account: \u201cmale and female he created them\u201d (Gen 1:27) no longer apply\". Although he didn't mention the topic, his words were interpreted by news media as denunciations of same-sex marriage,[190] with some sources adding that Benedict would have called it a threat to world peace similar to abortion and euthanasia.[191] In March 2012, he stated that heterosexual marriages should be defended from \"every possible misrepresentation of their true nature\".[192]\n[edit] International relations\nMain article: Foreign relations of the Holy See\n[edit] Migrants and refugees\nIn a message released 14 November 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of World Day for Migrants and Refugees, the pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, exiles, evacuees, and internally displaced persons. \"The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families,\" the pope said. \"Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done.\"[193]\n\n\n\n\nBenedict with President of Russia Vladimir Putin on 13 March 2007\n\n\nPope Benedict has also promoted various UN events, such as World Refugee Day, on which he offered up special prayers for refugees and called for the international community to do more to secure refugees' human rights. He also called on Catholic communities and organizations to offer them concrete help.[194]\n[edit] China\nMain article: People's Republic of China \u2013 Holy See relations\nIn 2007 Benedict sent a letter at Easter to Catholics in China that could have wide-ranging implications for the church's relationship with China's leadership. The letter provides long-requested guidance to Chinese bishops on how to respond to illicitly ordained bishops, as well as how to strengthen ties with the Patriotic Association and the Communist government.[195]\n[edit] Korea\nOn 13 November 2006, Benedict said the dispute over the North Korea nuclear weapons program should be resolved through negotiations, in his first public comment on the security issue, a news report said. \"The Holy See encourages bilateral or multilateral negotiations, convinced that the solution must be sought through peaceful means and in respect for agreements taken by all sides to obtain the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.\" Benedict was talking to the new Japanese ambassador to the Vatican.[196]\n[edit] Turkey\nMain article: Holy See \u2013 Turkey relations\nIn a 2004 Le Figaro interview, Ratzinger said that Turkey, which is demographically Muslim but governmentally secular by virtue of its state constitution, should seek its future in an association of Muslim nations rather than the European Union, which Ratzinger has stated has Christian roots. He said Turkey had always been \"in permanent contrast to Europe and that linking it to Europe would be a mistake\".[197]\nLater visiting the country to \"reiterate the solidarity between the cultures,\" it was reported that he made a counter-statement backing Turkey's bid to join the EU. Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said that the pope told him in their meeting that while the Vatican seeks to stay out of politics it desires Turkey's membership in the EU.[198][199] However, the Common Declaration of Pope Benedict XVI and Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople implied that support for Turkey's membership in the European Union would be contingent on the establishment of religious freedom in Turkey:[200] \"In every step towards unification, minorities must be protected, with their cultural traditions and the distinguishing features of their religion.\"[201] The Declaration also reiterates Pope Benedict XVI's call for Europe to preserve its Christian roots.\n[edit] Israel\nMain article: Holy See\u2013Israel relations\nIn May 2009 he visited Israel.[202][203] This was the third Papal visit to the Holy Land, the previous ones being made by Pope Paul VI in 1964 and Pope John Paul II in 2000.\n[edit] Vietnam\nMain article: Holy See \u2013 Vietnam relations\nPope Benedict XVI and Prime Minister Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng met at the Vatican on 25 January 2007 in a \"new and important step towards establishing diplomatic ties\".[204] The Pope met with President Nguy\u1ec5n Minh Tri\u1ebft on 11 December 2009. Vatican officials called the meeting \"a significant stage in the progress of bilateral relations with Vietnam.\"[205]\n[edit] Global economy\nIn 2009 the Pope intervened in global economic and political affairs with his third encyclical, Charity in Truth (Latin Caritas in Veritate), which can be viewed on the Vatican's web site.[206] The document sets out the Pope's position on the case for worldwide redistribution of wealth in considerable detail and goes on to discuss the environment, migration, terrorism, sexual tourism, bioethics, energy and population issues. The Financial Times has reported that the Pope's advocacy for a fairer redistribution of wealth has helped set the agenda for the 2009 July G8 summit.[207][208]\nAlso included in Charity in Truth is advocacy for tax choice:\n\nOne possible approach to development aid would be to apply effectively what is known as fiscal subsidiarity, allowing citizens to decide how to allocate a portion of the taxes they pay to the State. Provided it does not degenerate into the promotion of special interests, this can help to stimulate forms of welfare solidarity from below, with obvious benefits in the area of solidarity for development as well.\n\n[edit] Nuclear energy\nPope Benedict XVI has called for nuclear disarmament. At the same time, he has supported the peaceful use of nuclear energy as a tool for development and the fight against poverty. In his message for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the International Atomic Energy Agency, he confirmed: \"The Holy See, fully approving of the IAEA's goal, has been a member from the organisation's foundation and continues to support its activity.\"[209]\n[edit] Interests\n\n\n\n\nPope Benedict XVI after a musical concert offered to his honor. circa 2008.\n\n\nPope Benedict is known to be deeply interested in classical music,[21] and is an accomplished pianist.[210] He has a grand piano in his papal quarters. The Pontiff's favorite composer is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, of whose music the Pope said: \"His music is by no means just entertainment; it contains the whole tragedy of human existence.\"[211] Benedict also stated that Mozart's music affected him greatly as a young man and \"deeply penetrated his soul.\"[211] Benedict's favorite works of music are Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet.[212]\nPope Benedict has recorded an album of contemporary classical music in which Benedict sings and recites prayers to the Blessed Virgin Mary.[213] The album was set for release on 30 November 2009.\nPope Benedict is also known to be fond of cats.[21] As Cardinal Ratzinger he was known (according to former neighbours) to look after stray cats in his neighbourhood. A book called Joseph and Chico: A Cat Recounts the Life of Pope Benedict XVI was published in 2007 which told the story of the Pope's life from the feline Chico's perspective. This story was inspired by an orange tabby Pentling cat, which belonged to the family next door.[214] During his trip to Australia for World Youth Day in 2008 the media reported that festival organizers lent the Pope a grey cat called Bella[215] in order to keep him company during his stay.[216]\nIn December 2012, the Vatican announced Benedict had joined social networking website Twitter, under the handle @Pontifex.[217] His first tweet was made on 12 December and was \"Dear friends, I am pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter. Thank you for your generous response. I bless all of you from my heart.\"[218]\n[edit] Honours and awards\n\nThis article incorporates information from the equivalent article on the Italian Wikipedia.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedallion in Saint Paul Outside the Walls\n\n\nPope Benedict is Grand Master of the following Orders: Supreme Order of Christ, Order of the Golden Spur, Order of Pius IX, Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great and the Order of St. Sylvester.\n\n1977 Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit of the Republic of Ecuador\n1977 Knight Grand Cross of the Bavarian Order of Merit\n1985 Grand Merit Cross with Star and Sash of the Federal Republic of Germany\n1985 Constitutional Medal of the Bavarian State Parliament in Gold\n1989 Ordine della Minerva at the University of Chieti\n1989 Augustin Bea Prize (Rome)\n1989 Karl-Valentin-Orden (Munich)\n1991 Leopold Kunschak Prize (Vienna)\n1991 Georg von Hertling Medal of Kartellverband katholischer deutscher Studentenvereine\n1992 Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Sash for Services to the Republic of Austria\n1992 Literature Prize Capri S.

Benedict's coat of arms has omitted the papal tiara, which traditionally appears in the background to designate the Pope's position as a worldly ruler like a king, replacing it with a simple mitre, emphasising his spiritual authority.[219]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscutcheon\n\nGules, chape in or, with the scallop shell of the second; the dexter chape with a moor's head in natural colour, crowned and collared of the first, the sinister chape a bear trippant in natural colour, carrying a pack gules belted sable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbolism\n\nScallop shell: The symbolism of the scallop shell is multiple; one reference is to Saint Augustine. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Fr. Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church, and therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.\nMoor of Freising: The Moor's head is an heraldic charge associated with Freising, Germany.\nCorbinian's bear: A legend states that while travelling to Rome, Saint Corbinian's pack horse was killed by a bear. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned to Bavaria. The implication is that \"Christianity tamed and domesticated the ferocity of paganism and thus laid the foundations for a great civilisation in the Duchy of Bavaria.\" At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolises the weight of office that Benedict now carries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Writings\nMain article: Pope Benedict XVI bibliography\nPope Benedict XVI has written 66 books.

He is the Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for Bishops, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 2001. He retired as Prefect on 30 June 2010, having turned 75 (the age at which prelates must submit their resignations to the Pope), and was succeeded by the Archbishop of Quebec and Primate of Canada, Marc Ouellet, P.S.S. Cardinal Re will be the senior cardinal-elector to attend the conclave to elect a successor to Pope Benedict XVI, and as such will chair the conclave.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early life and ordination\n1.2 Secretariat of State\n1.3 Congregation for Bishops\n1.4 Curial memberships\n\n\n2 Views\n\n2.1 Temperament\n2.2 Lincoln excommunications\n2.3 Response to Stanis\u0142aw Wielgus Scandal\n2.4 Society of Saint Pius X\n2.5 Brazilian abortion\n\n\n3 References\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Biography\n[edit] Early life and ordination\nBorn in Borno, Italy as the son of the carpenter Matteo Re (1908\u20132012)[1] Giovanni Battista Re was ordained a priest by Archbishop Giacinto Tredici in Brescia on 3 March 1957, Re has been a member of the Roman Curia since 1963. He elevated to monsignor the next year and served in various diplomatic positions before being named both bishop of the titular see of Forum Novum and Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops on 9 October 1987. Pope John Paul II administered the episcopal consecration one month later, on 7 November.\n[edit] Secretariat of State\nOn 12 December 1989, he was transferred to become Sostituto for General Affairs of the Secretariat of State, one of the key positions under the Cardinal Secretary of State. In this position he became known as one of the most influential men at the Vatican, though his position was of too low rank for him to be named a cardinal; there was unfounded speculation that he was one of the two men named secretly (in pectore) as cardinals in the consistory of 1998.[citation needed]\n\n\nStyles of\nGiovanni Battista Re\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\n[edit] Congregation for Bishops\nHe was named on 16 September 2000 to head the Congregation for Bishops and the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. Re became Cardinal-Priest of Ss. XII Apostoli in the consistory held 21 February named first among all those elevated. The next year, on 1 October, he was named Cardinal Bishop of Sabina-Poggio Mirteto when a vacancy arose in that order.\nSince all major Vatican officials automatically lose their positions during a sede vacante, Re too lost his position as Prefect on 2 April 2005 upon the death of John Paul II. He was later confirmed to office by Pope Benedict XVI on 21 April 2005. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.[citation needed]\n[edit] Curial memberships\nRe is a member of various offices of the Curia. In May 2008, Pope Benedict named Cardinal Re as a member of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts. He is also a member and therefore attends weekly meetings of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Congregation for the Oriental Churches in addition to the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See. He will hold these memberships until his 80th birthday.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Temperament\nInsiders describe him as a friend of Carlo Maria Martini, who has played a major role in the dissent against the last three Popes. As leader of the Congregation for Bishops, Re reportedly appointed several bishops in Germany, France and elsewhere, who opposed some of the stances of John Paul II and Benedict XVI.[2]\n[edit] Lincoln excommunications\nIn 1996, Irish bishop Fabian Bruskewitz gained national attention[3] for asserting that local Catholics who are members of several associations thought to be \"totally incompatible with the Catholic Faith\" would incur automatic excommunication.[4] These groups include Call to Action and its Nebraska affiliate, Call to Action Nebraska,[5] the family planning provider Planned Parenthood and its affiliate Catholics for a Free Choice, the Freemasons and their affiliate organizations, Job's Daughters, DeMolay, Eastern Star and Rainbow Girls, and the pro-euthanasia Hemlock Society (now renamed Compassion & Choices). His pronouncement was appealed to Rome, but in 2006 the ruling was upheld by Cardinal Re, the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops.[6][7]\n[edit] Response to Stanis\u0142aw Wielgus Scandal\nRe, who assists the pope in deciding the future careers of the clergy as Prefect of Bishops, said that, \"When Monsignor Wielgus was nominated, we did not know anything about his collaboration with the secret services.\"[citation needed]\n[edit] Society of Saint Pius X\nIn January 2009, he published a decree removing the excommunications from the bishops of the Society of Saint Pius X.[8] He later expressed regret over the move after the controversy on the comments of Bishop Richard Williamson.[9] Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos has argued that if anyone in the Vatican should have known about Williamson's negationist views, it was not himself but rather Cardinal Re, due to the fact that Re is responsible for the Congregation of Bishops, which oversees information about bishops and prelates.[10][11]\n[edit] Brazilian abortion\nIn 2009, Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Cardoso Sobrinho of Olinda and Recife stated that the automatic excommunication decreed by canon 1398 had been incurred by the mother and the doctors who had an abortion performed on a 9-year-old girl who was four months pregnant with twin fetuses resulting from abuse by her stepfather.[12] The doctors argued the girl was so small that her uterus did not have the ability to contain one child let alone two.[13] Those under sixteen years of age are not subject to any ecclesiastical censures such as excommunication,[14] still less to automatic (latae sententiae) censures,[15] and so canon 1398 did not apply to the girl herself.\nHealth Minister Jos\u00e9 Gomes Tempor\u00e3o criticized the Church's position as \"extreme, radical and inadequate\",[12] and President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva also denounced it.[16][17] Cardinal Re defended the archbishop's statement, commenting: \"It is a sad case, but the real problem is that the twins conceived were two innocent persons, who had the right to live and could not be eliminated. Life must always be protected. The attack on the Brazilian church is unjustified.\"[17]\n[edit] References\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to: Giovanni Battista Re\n\n\n\n\n^ \"Kardinal Giovanni Battista Re ist (nicht) tot \u2013 Unr\u00fchmliche Rolle in den F\u00e4llen Bischof Krenn und Pfarrer Wagner?\" (in German).

He studied at the Episcopal Seminary of Ascoli Piceno and later at the Archiepiscopal Seminary of Fermo. He continued his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome where he earned his licentiate in theology and at the Pontifical Lateran University where he was awarded a doctorate in canon law. He was ordained in 15 July 1956 in Fermo. After this he studied in Rome until 1960.\nHe served as secretary of nunciature in Per\u00fa, 1960-1962; in nunciature in Brazil 1962-1966; auditor in nunciature in Chile, 1966-1967. He was recalled to the Vatican as secretary of Cardinal Cicognani and subsequently Cardinal Villot during their terms as secretaries of State, and later a head of the secretariat of the Sostituto, 1967-1974. The decision was taken to appoint him to the rank of Counselor of nunciature in France with special charge before the Council of Europe, 1974-1976. He was created Prelate of honour on 30 April 1974. In 1976, Pope Paul VI appointed him Titular Archbishop of Caesarea in Mauretania and at the same time Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Madagascar and Mauritius. Sebastiani became Apostolic Nuncio (ambassador of the Holy See), to Turkey in 1985. In 1994, he was appointed General Secretary of the Central Committee for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000.\nIn 1997, Sebastiani was made President of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See, part of the Roman Curia, responsible for auditing the temporal possessions of the Holy See. He served in this position (with a legally required interruption during the 2005 sede vacante) until his resignation on 12 April 2008. Pope Benedict XVI named Velasio De Paolis as Sebastiani's successor.[1]\nSebastiani was created and proclaimed Cardinal-Deacon of S. Eustachio on 21 February 2001, and was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. On 21 February 2011, he opted for the order of Cardinal Priest, with his former diaconal church elevated to the level of cardinalitial title.[2] He turns 80 and lost voting rights in future papal conclave on 11 April 2011.\nSebastiani is the spiritual guide and protector of the Sovereign Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, Knights of Malta.[3]\n[edit] External links\n\nProfile of Sergio Sebastiani on Catholic Hierarchy\nProfile in Salvador Miranda's biographical dictionary\nProfile on GCatholic.com\n\n[edit] Sources\n\n\n^ \"Rinuncia del Presidente della Prefettura degli Affari Economici della Santa Sede e nomina del successore\" (in Italian) (Press release).

He taught theology at the Lateran and Urbanian Pontifical Universities and then studied at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy.\n[edit] Career in the Curia\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Cardinal Sepe\n\n\nHe joined the diplomatic service of the Holy See and was posted to Brazil from 1972 to 1975, when he was recalled to the Secretariat of State, becoming Assessor for General Affairs in 1987. Sepe was appointed Secretary of the Congregation for the Clergy and Titular Archbishop of Gradum on 2 April 1992.\nOn 3 November 1997, he was named General Secretary of the Central Committee for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. He was President of Peregrinatio ad Petri Sedem from 8 November 1997 until July 2001. On 9 April 2001 he was named Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. He is also the Grand Chancellor of the Pontifical Urban University. Created and proclaimed Cardinal-Deacon of Dio Padre misericordioso by Pope John Paul II in the Consistory of 21 February 2001. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nCurial membership:\n\nClergy, Doctrine of the Faith (congregations)\nSocial Communications, Interreligious Dialogue, Christian Unity, Legislative Texts (councils)\nLatin America (commission)\nSpecial Council for Asia of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops\n\n\n\n\n\nA statue of Sepe\n\n\n[edit] Cardinal-Archbishop of Naples\nHe was appointed Archbishop of Naples and his Cardinal-Deaconry was elevated pro hac vice to Cardinal-Priest on 20 May 2006 (it was too early for him to opt for the order of cardinal priests).\nCardinal Sepe's move to Naples from the prefect's post at the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples made him the first head of a Roman dicastery in decades to be dispatched to a diocese and, in the eyes of some, the first casualty of Pope Benedict's purge of the church's administration.\nCardinal Sepe has been a member of Facebook, where he collected the maximum of 5,000 friends.\nIn June 2010, Sepe was under investigation by Perugia's public prosecutor's office over alleged corruption cases.[2] Media reports alleged that during his time as prefect, various \u201cPropaganda Fide\u201d apartments were made available, free or for a very low rent, to a variety of public figures including politicians, lawyers and journalists. However, Cardinal Sepe has reportedly said that he has \u201cnothing to hide\u201d and he is expected to waive his Vatican extraterritorial privilege in order to meet investigators.[3]\nCardinal Sepe said[citation needed] in the homily at his morning Mass, appeared[who?] to refer implicitly to the probe, speaking of the \"many martyrs\" who, \"in the name of truth and of Christ, remained faithful to his Gospel when they were tortured, humiliated and disrespected.\" He continued saying \"We must not be afraid,\" he said, according to an Italian wire report. After Calvary, there will be the light of the resurrection.\"\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Clerical celibacy\nMany of his memorable statements came from 1995 to 1997 and involved disagreement with the idea of ending the celibate priesthood.\nIn 1997 he said a relaxing of the celibacy rule for Latin Rite priests would not ease the vocations crisis and would have no theological or pastoral foundation. Linked to his position he also is active in evangelizing efforts.\n[edit] Priest-sharing program\nIn 1995 he helped implement a priest-sharing program among dioceses worldwide to help redress the geographical imbalance in vocations.\n[edit] Return of priests\nIn that year he further said that the Vatican was facilitating the return of hundreds of priests who had left the active ministry and married in civil ceremonies, but who were now divorced or widowed and were \u201csincerely sorry\u201d for having strayed from their vocation.\n[edit] Crime in Naples\nAs Archbishop in 2007 he called on \"the youth of Italy's murder capital to unsheathe [their] courage and hand over their knives in church, anonymously and without penalty\"[4].\n[edit] References\n\n^ \"Vatican appoints seasoned diplomat to direct church's worldwide missionary work\".

He was Cardinal Secretary of State from 1990 to 2006, under both popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI. On 27 April 2005, he was elected to succeed Benedict XVI as Dean of the College of Cardinals by his fellow Cardinal Bishops. Sodano was the first person since 1828 to serve simultaneously as Dean and Secretary of State.\nOn 22 June 2006, Benedict XVI accepted Sodano's resignation as Secretary of State, effective on 15 September 2006. He was succeeded by Tarcisio Bertone, then Archbishop of Genoa.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life\n2 Apostolic nuncio\n3 Secretary of State\n4 Relationship with Legion of Christ\n5 Easter 2010 comments and aftermath\n6 Honors and awards\n\n6.1 Foreign Honors\n6.2 House Orders\n6.3 Awards\n\n\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life\nThe second of six children, Angelo Sodano was born in Isola d'Asti, Piedmont, to Giovanni and Delfina Sodano. His father was a Christian Democrat deputy in the Italian Parliament for three terms from 1948 until 1963. After studying philosophy and theology at the seminary of Asti, Sodano was ordained a priest by Bishop Umberto Rossi on 23 September 1950, and then did pastoral work and taught dogmatic theology at the Asti seminary.\nHe then furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Gregorian University, from where he obtained a doctorate in theology, and at the Pontifical Lateran University, earning a doctorate in canon law. In 1959 he entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See. He served as secretary in nunciatures in Latin America, and was given the title of monsignor, initially with the rank of Chaplain of His Holiness and later with that of Honorary Prelate. In 1968 he was called to work in the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church in the Vatican.\n[edit] Apostolic nuncio\nOn 30 November 1977, Sodano, who speaks English and German, as well as Spanish, French and Italian, was appointed a titular archbishop of Nova Caesaris and the apostolic nuncio to Chile, one of the countries where he had served as nunciature secretary. He was ordained a bishop in his native Asti by Cardinal Antonio Samor\u00e9 on 15 January 1978.\nHe arrived at a difficult moment, with Chile on the brink of war with Argentina over the Beagle Channel and Augusto Pinochet in power.[1]\nIn 1980, together with Cardinal Ra\u00fal Silva Henr\u00edquez, he tried without success to get Pinochet to allow the return of certain political exiles, and in 1984 he obtained, at the cost of a dispute between the Holy See and the military government of Chile, safe conduct for four members of the Revolutionary Left Movement, who had sought diplomatic asylum in the nunciature, to leave for Ecuador.[1]\nIn 1987, when Pope John Paul II visited Chile, Pinochet availed of the visit that the Pope regularly paid to a country's head of state to get the Pope to appear with him at a balcony of the presidential palace, although this was not in the agreed program. On the other hand, Sodano arranged a meeting in the nunciature between the Pope and the leaders of the opposition.[1]\nSeven Chilean priests then wrote to the Pope to have Sodano removed from his post as Nuncio. What the Pope did in fact in the following year was to appoint Sodano the Holy See's Secretary of the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church, a post corresponding to that of a foreign minister, and on 1 December 1990 named him to the highest post in the Roman Curia, that of Secretary of State, creating him Cardinal-Priest of the titular church of S. Maria Nuova on 28 June 1991.\nOn 27 December 1998, he wrote, at the request of the democratic government of Chile, an official letter to the British prime minister Tony Blair stating that \"the Chilean Government considers it an offence to its territorial sovereignty as a nation the fact of being deprived of the power to judge its own citizens\" through the detention of Pinochet in Britain.[1]\n[edit] Secretary of State\nOn 10 January 1994, Pope John Paul II named Sodano Cardinal Bishop of the suburbicarian see of Albano, and on 30 November 2002, exactly twenty-five years after he was first appointed a bishop, he was elected vice-dean of the College of Cardinals in succession to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who became Dean. On Ratzinger's election as Pope in the 2005 conclave, it fell to Sodano to perform the functions allotted to the Dean at the end of the conclave (asking the pope-elect if he accepted the election, and then asking what name the new pope wanted to use) and at Benedict XVI's Papal Inauguration. On 30 April Benedict formally ratified Sodano's election to the position by the suburbicarian Cardinal Bishops. Accordingly the title of the suburbicarian see of Ostia, proper of the dean, was added to the title of the see of Albano.\n\n\n\n\nThe two Secretaries of State: Cardinal Sodano (Secretary of State of the Holy See) with Condoleezza Rice (Secretary of State of the U.S.).\n\n\nDue to the deteriorating health of John Paul II, it was Cardinal Sodano, as Secretary of State, who was the principal celebrant at the funeral Masses for Cardinal John O'Connor and Mother Teresa. When in 2002 Sodano turned 75, John Paul specifically invited him to stay on as Secretary of State, though this is the customary retirement age for heads of major Vatican departments. (There is no retirement age for the Deanship or Vice-Deanship.)\nWhen Pope John Paul II died on 2 April 2005, Sodano, who participated in the 2005 papal conclave, was not generally seen as one of the papabili, the cardinals likely to become the next pope. This was largely due to his advanced age, although he is seven months younger than the cardinal who was eventually elected, Pope Benedict XVI, and his lack of experience outside the Roman Curia.\nSodano's position as Secretary of State expired upon the death of John Paul II. But Benedict XVI reappointed him to the position on 21 April 2005, in spite of being past the customary retirement age.\nOn 22 June 2006, Benedict XVI appointed Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone to replace Sodano as the Secretary of State. Bertone assumed the new office on 15 September 2006.\nSodano turned 80 on 23 November 2007, and is ineligible to participate in any future conclaves, though he remains Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals.\nOn Tuesday, 18 September 2012, Cardinal Sodano was named by Pope Benedict XVI as one of the Synod Fathers of the 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Catholic Synod of Bishops.[2]\n[edit] Relationship with Legion of Christ\n\n\n\n\nThe entrance of the Pontificia Accademia Ecclesiastica. The coat of arms on the left is that of Cardinal Sodano, Cardinal Protector of the PEA.\n\n\nSodano was the recipient of financial gifts from the members of the Legion of Christ. According to an ex-member of the Legion: \"Cardinal Sodano was the cheerleader for the Legion. He'd come give a talk at Christmas and they'd give him $10,000. Another priest recalled a $5,000 donation to Sodano.[3]\nIn 1998 Sodano intervened to halt an investigation into sexual abuse by the Legion's founder, Marcial Maciel. The investigation had been headed by Joseph Ratzinger, who at the time was head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. After Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI, the Vatican published a report finding that Maciel had sexually abused young men and fathered at least one child.[3]\nAusten Ivereigh argues that Sodano was \"bought\" by financial gifts from Maciel and other members of the Legion of Christ, and should resign.[4]\n[edit] Easter 2010 comments and aftermath\nIn his address as Dean of the College of Cardinals to Pope Benedict XVI at Easter 2010, Sodano told him: \"The people of God are with you and do not allow themselves to be impressed by the petty gossip of the moment, by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers.\" Victims of clerical sex abuse interpreted the \"petty gossip\" remark as a highly inappropriate reference to their complaints.[5][6]\nOn 8 May 2010, the Austrian Catholic news agency Kathpress published remarks made by Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn in what was supposed to be a private conversation with newspaper editors. The Austrian cardinal criticized Sodano's dismissal of the complaints of sex abuse as \"petty gossip\" and, in addition, accused him of having indirectly blocked an investigation that then-Cardinal Ratzinger intended, as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, to carry out into accusations against Sch\u00f6nborn's predecessor Cardinal Hans Hermann Gro\u00ebr. Sch\u00f6nborn added: \"The days of cover-up are over. For a long while the Church's principle of forgiveness was falsely interpreted and was in favour of those responsible and not the victims.\"[7][8]\n[edit] Honors and awards\n[edit] Foreign Honors\n\n1995 \u2013 \u00a0Malta\u00a0: Honorary Companion of Honour of the National Order of Merit (04.02.1995[9])\n1988 \u2013 \u00a0Italy\u00a0: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (Cavaliere di Gran Croce Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana)\n1997 \u2013 \u00a0Slovakia\u00a0: Grand Cross (or 1st Class) of the Order of the White Double Cross[10]\n2001 \u2013 \u00a0SMOM\u00a0: Collar of the Order Pro Merito Melitense of the Sovereign Order of Malta\n2004 \u2013 \u00a0Romania\u00a0: Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Star of Romania\n2006 \u2013 \u00a0Poland\u00a0: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland\n\n[edit] House Orders\n\n2002: \u00a0House of Savoy: Order of the Most Holy Annunciation (Ordine Supremo della Santissima Annunziata)\n\n[edit] Awards\n\n2004: International Prize Vittorino Colombo (Fondazione Vittorino Colombo \u2013 Prizes)\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n\n\nCatholicism  portal\n\n\n\n\n\n^ a b c d Sodano, el contacto de Chile en el Vaticano in El Mercurio on 21 November 2004.

He served as Major Penitentiary of the Apostolic Penitentiary from 2003 to 2009.[1] He previously served as President of the Pontifical Council for the Laity (1996\u20132003), Archbishop of Denver (1986\u201396), Bishop of Memphis (1982\u201386), and Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore (1976\u201382).[2] He was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope John Paul II in 1998.[3]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Priesthood\n3 Episcopacy\n\n3.1 Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore\n3.2 Bishop of Memphis\n3.3 Archbishop of Denver\n\n\n4 Career in the Roman Curia\n5 Criticism of Barack Obama\n6 See also\n7 References\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and education\nj. Francis Stafford was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the only child of Francis Emmett and Mary Dorothy (n\u00e9e Stanton) Stafford.[3] His father was the owner of a furniture store, which had been opened by his grandfather (an Irish immigrant) in 1902.[4] He was raised in Catonsville, and graduated from Loyola High School in 1950.[4] He then entered Loyola College in Baltimore with the intent of pursuing a career in medicine.[5] However, in 1952, the death of a close friend in a car crash caused him to rethink his future and to enter St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore.[5]\nStafford attended St. Mary's Seminary for two years before being sent by Archbishop Francis Keough to continue his studies in Rome at the Pontifical North American College and the Pontifical Gregorian University.[3] He earned a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Gregorian in 1958.[5]\n[edit] Priesthood\nWhile in Rome, Stafford was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Martin O'Connor on December 15, 1957.[2] He was ordained alongside Edward Egan, who would become a cardinal and Archbishop of New York.[6] His first assignment, after returning to the United States, was as assistant pastor at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church[7] in Baltimore, where he remained until 1962.[1] He then studied at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he earned a Master of Social Work degree in 1964 with a thesis on the foster care of children.[3]\nFrom 1964 to 1966, Stafford served as assistant director of the archdiocesan Catholic Charities and assistant pastor of St. Ann Church[8] in Baltimore.[1] He was later named director of the Archdiocesan Catholic Charities by Cardinal Lawrence Shehan in 1966, serving for ten years.[4] In 1970, he was created a Chaplain of His Holiness by Pope Paul VI.[3] He was elected president of the Presbyteral Senate for the archdiocese the following year.[1] He also helped reorganize the central services of the archdiocese and create its collegial structures.[5]\n[edit] Episcopacy\n[edit] Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore\nOn January 11, 1976, Stafford was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore and Titular Bishop of Respecta by Pope Paul VI.[2] He received his episcopal consecration on the following February 29 from Archbishop William Borders, with Cardinal Shehan and Bishop Thomas Murphy serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen.[2] He selected as his episcopal motto: In principium erat Verbum, which is Latin for: \"In the beginning was the Word\" (John 1:1).[3]\nAs an auxiliary bishop, he served as vicar general of the Archdiocese of Baltimore from 1976 to 1982.[1] From 1978 to 1984, he led the U.S. Catholic Conference Commission on Marriage and Family Life.[5] He also served as administrator of Sts. Philip and James Church[9] (1980\u201381).[1] He attended the Fifth Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Vatican City from September to October 1980.[3]\n[edit] Bishop of Memphis\nOn November 17, 1982, Stafford was appointed the second Bishop of Memphis, Tennessee, by Pope John Paul II.[2] He was installed on January 17, 1983.[4] During his tenure, he revised the structure of the Pastoral Office, improved the fiscal conditions of the diocese, and concentrated on the evangelization of African Americans.[10]\nIn addition to his duties in Memphis, he was chairman of the USCCB Commission for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs (1984\u201391) and co-president of the Dialogue between Roman Catholics and Lutherans (1984\u201397).[1]\n[edit] Archbishop of Denver\nFollowing the death of Archbishop James Casey, Stafford was appointed the third Archbishop of Denver, Colorado, on June 3, 1986.[2] He was installed at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on the following July 30.[4]\nDuring his tenure, he hosted the 1993 World Youth Day in Denver, which was the first WYD in North America. In his last year as archbishop, he launched the first capital campaign in forty years and a \"Strategic Plan\" for Catholic schools.[5]\n[edit] Career in the Roman Curia\nArchbishop Stafford was appointed president of the Pontifical Council for the Laity on August 20, 1996, he became Cardinal-Deacon of Ges\u00f9 Buon Pastore alla Montagnola in the consistory of 1998.\nIn 2003, Cardinal Stafford was appointed Major Penitentiary, overseeing matters pertaining to indulgences and the internal forum of the Church. He was thus one of the highest ranking American members of the Roman Curia and the second to serve as Major Penitentiary, the other being William Wakefield Baum. The Major Penitentiary is one of the few Curia officials whose office is not automatically suspended upon the death of the pope, and is the only one allowed to be in contact with anyone outside the conclave.\nIn accordance with canon 354 of the Code of Canon Law, Cardinal Stafford submitted his letter of resignation to Pope Benedict XVI on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 2007. On June 2, 2009 Pope Benedict appointed as his successor Fortunato Baldelli, who was then Apostolic Nuncio to France.[11]\nStafford was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nOn March 1, 2008, Cardinal Stafford took the option, after ten years as a Cardinal Deacon, for promotion to the rank of Cardinal-Priest, and was assigned the titular church of San Pietro in Montorio.[12]\nIn 2009 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology and inducted into their College of Fellows.\n[edit] Criticism of Barack Obama\nThe on-line version of the National Catholic Reporter reported on November 19, 2008 that Cardinal Stafford harshly criticized President-elect Barack Obama, saying he has \"an agenda and vision that are aggressive, disruptive and apocalyptic.\"[13]\nThe story was first reported by The Tower, the student newspaper of the Catholic University of America, where Stafford made those remarks.\nSaying that the United States experienced a \"cultural earthquake\" when Obama was elected president November 4, 2008, Stafford said the president-elect \"appears to be a relaxed, smiling man\" with rhetorical skills that are \"very highly developed.\" \"But under all that grace and charm, there is a tautness of will, a state of constant alertness, to attack and resist any external influence that might affect his will,\" he added. The cardinal compared the upcoming years of the Obama administration to \"Jesus' agony in the Garden of Gethsemane.\"[14]\nThe Catholic News Agency revealed more details about the highly controversial words of the cardinal on November 17, 2008: \"If 1968 was the year of America\u2019s 'suicide attempt,' 2008 is the year of America's exhaustion,\" he said, contrasting the year of Humanae Vitae's promulgation with this election year. \"For the next few years, Gethsemane will not be marginal. We will know that garden,\" Cardinal Stafford told his audience.[15] Catholics who weep the \"hot, angry tears of betrayal\" should try to identify with Jesus, who during his agony in the garden was \"sick because of love.\" The cardinal also attributed America's decline to Supreme Court decisions such as the 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade, which imposed \"permissive abortion laws nationwide.\"\n[edit] See also\n\nAmerican bishops serving outside the United States\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g \"STAFFORD Card.

Attracted to life as a priest at an early age, Szoka attended St. Joseph's Seminary in Grand Rapids, Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit for his junior and senior years, and then St. John's Provincial Seminary in Plymouth, Michigan to study theology.[citation needed]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Priesthood\n2 Episcopal ministry\n3 Roman Curia\n4 Retirement\n5 See also\n6 References\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Priesthood\nOn June 5, 1954, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Thomas Noa in St. Peter's Cathedral in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. He did pastoral work in Manistique but soon thereafter became secretary to Bishop Noa of Marquette, whom he accompanied to the first session of the Second Vatican Council in 1962. During this period he also served as chaplain at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital and K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base. From 1957 to 1959, he studied canon law at the Pontifical Urbaniana University or the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. Upon returning to the United States, Szoka did pastoral and curial work, including serving as an official of the matrimonial tribunal, in Marquette until 1971. He was raised to the rank of Honorary Prelate of His Holiness on November 14, 1963, by Pope Paul VI.[citation needed]\n[edit] Episcopal ministry\nSzoka was appointed the first Bishop of Gaylord on June 11, 1971. He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 20 from Cardinal John Francis Dearden, with Bishops Charles Salatka and Joseph McKinney serving as co-consecrators. A year later, the Bishops of the 4th pastoral region of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) elected him president for the period of 1972-77. At the same time, he was treasurer and secretary of the Episcopal Conference of Michigan. As Bishop of Gaylord, Szoka improved the annulment consideration process, drawing from his experience in the matrimonial tribunal in Marquette.[citation needed]\nOn March 21, 1981, he was promoted to the third Metropolitan Archbishop of Detroit (eighth bishop) by Pope John Paul II. Since 1981, he also served as president of the Administration Council of the provincial seminary of St. John in Plymouth, Michigan and SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary near Orchard Lake Village, Michigan. He was also a president of the board of directors of the Episcopal Conference of Michigan, member of the executive committee of The Catholic University of America, president of the Committee for University Relations, Administrator of the National Sanctuary of the Immaculate Conception, treasurer of the NCCB, and served on committees within the Conference for: human values, bishops, dioceses and provinces, and economic affairs. He faced challenges of finance and enforcing Church discipline, and welcomed John Paul II to Detroit in 1987 during his tenure as Archbishop.\nIn 1983, he dealt with the case of Agnes Mary Mansour, a nun and the director of the Michigan Department of Community Health who worked to continue abortion services in Michigan. Szoka had given his permission for Mansour to serve the state but said she must oppose publicly funded abortion. Mansour believed abortion was tragic but should be legal, and she continued disbursing Medicaid abortion funds. Szoka appealed to Mansour's superiors in the Sisters of Mercy but the order supported her stance.[1] Szoka referred the case to the Vatican, and Bishop Anthony Bevilacqua resolved it by ordering Mansour to resign either her government post or her orders. Mansour left the sisterhood.[2]\nHe was created Cardinal-Priest of Ss. Andrea e Gregorio al Monte Celio by John Paul II in the consistory of June 28, 1988.\n[edit] Roman Curia\nResigning as Archbishop of Detroit on April 28, 1990, Szoka was named President of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See on January 22, 1990 to October 14, 1997. In this position, he helped managed the Vatican's financial affairs\nOn October 14, 1997, Cardinal Szoka was named President of the Governorate of Vatican City State, and on February 22, 2001, President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. Within the Roman Curia his membership includes: Secretariat of State (second section), and Causes of Saints, Bishops, Evangelization of Peoples (Congregatio de Propaganda Fide), Clergy, Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life (congregations). He submitted his resignation to John Paul II in 2002, at the Church's mandatory retirement age of 75, but was requested to continue working. During his rare spare time, Szoka enjoyed walking through the Vatican Gardens.[3]\nSzoka was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. As Governor of the Vatican, it fell to Szoka, along with Secretary of State Angelo Sodano and Camerlengo Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Somalo, to prepare for the cardinal electors' housing at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.\n[edit] Retirement\nIt was announced on June 22, 2006, that his resignation had been accepted by Pope Benedict and that he would officially step down on September 15, 2006; he maintained all curial memberships until age 80. On what he would do after retirement, Szoka said he was interested in travel, writing, studying the Church Fathers, and continuing to provide priestly assistance to Detroit.[4]\n[edit] See also\n\n\n\n\nMetro Detroit  portal\n\n\n\nCatholicism  portal\n\n\n\nBiography  portal\n\n\n\n\nList of the Catholic bishops of the United States#American bishops serving outside the United States\n\n[edit] References\n\n^ \"The Nun vs. the Archbishop\", Time, March 21, 1983.\n^ \"Obey or Leave\".

He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Marius Maziers on 20 September 1969 and worked as a curate in the Archdiocese of Bordeaux before entering the Vatican's diplomatic service in 1975. He was secretary of the nunciatures to the Dominican Republic (1975\u20131978) and to Lebanon (1979\u20131983). Tauran became an official of the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church in 1983, and then participated in special missions in Haiti (1984), and Beirut and Damascus (1986). He was also a member of the Vatican delegation to the meetings of the Conference on European Security and Cooperation, Conference on Disarmament in Stockholm, and Cultural Forum in Budapest and later Vienna.\n[edit] Secretary for Relations with States\nOn 1 December 1990, Tauran was appointed Secretary for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State and Titular Archbishop of Thelepte by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on 6 January 1991 from John Paul II himself, with Archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Justin Francis Rigali serving as co-consecrators, in St. Peter's Basilica. As Secretary, Tauran essentially served as the foreign minister of the Vatican. In regards to the Iraqi conflict, he once emphasized the importance of dialogue and the United Nations,[1] and said that \"a unilateral war of aggression would constitute a crime against peace and against the Geneva Conventions\".[2]\n[edit] Archivist and Librarian of the Holy Roman Church\nHe was created Cardinal-Deacon of Sant'Apollinare alle Terme by Pope John Paul in the consistory of 21 October 2003. On the following 24 November, he was named Archivist and Librarian of the Holy Roman Church, overseeing the Vatican Secret Archives and Vatican Library.\nIn late 2003, Tauran mourned the \"second-class\" treatment of non-Muslims in \"many Muslim countries,\" especially Saudi Arabia.[1]\nRepresenting the Pope, Tauran attended the March 2005 dedication of the new Holocaust museum at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. That same year, he was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] President of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue\nIn spite of having Parkinson's disease, Tauran was appointed as President of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue on 25 June 2007, showing that the disease was not getting worse and he was able to handle more responsibility. He took over this position on 1 September 2007. In this post, he is also in charge of the Commission for Religious Relations with Muslims.\nIn addition to his duties as president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, he is a member of the Secretariat of State (Second Section); the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith; the Congregation for the Oriental Churches; the Congregation for Bishops; the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity; the Pontifical Council for Culture; the Apostolic Signatura; the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See; the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, and the Cardinal Commission for the Supervision of the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR).\nHe is a friend of Anglican Dr. John Andrew, former rector of St. Thomas Church in New York City. For Andrews' fiftieth anniversary of his ordination in late June 2007, Cardinal Tauran traveled to New York and served as a guest preacher.[1]\nHe was a friend of Anglican Dr. Roger Greenacre, former Precentor of Chichester Cathedral in England. For Greenacre's fiftieth anniversary of his ordination at Michaelmas (the Feast of the Archangel Saint Michael) of 2005, Cardinal Tauran traveled to Chichester and served as a guest preacher.[citation needed] Cardinal Tauran delivered a tribute at Greenacre's Memorial Requiem in Chichester Cathedral on 23 September 2011.[citation needed]\nAccording to an online news story article written by Cindy Wooden of Catholic News Service (CNS), posted on 3 April 2012:\n\n\"If the openness, questioning and hopes of young people are encouraged and guided, they become a stimulus for the adults around them to take seriously the challenges of building a better world marked by dialogue and acceptance, a Vatican official told Buddhists around the world. ... \"Young people are an asset for all societies,\" said Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, in a message marking the upcoming Buddhist celebration of Vesakh, a feast commemorating the key events in the life of the Buddha. ... Cardinal Tauran said that as students around the world increasingly have classmates with different beliefs from their own, schools have a responsibility to guide the young in reflecting on their own beliefs, learning about the beliefs and religious practices of others and growing in respect for others.\"[3]\n\n[edit] Views\n[edit] War in Iraq\nCardinal Tauran was a fierce critic of the United States over questions of war and peace. He described the American-led invasion of Iraq as a \u201ccrime against peace\u201d and a violation of international law if undertaken.[4] He asserted that the facts speak for themselves on Iraq and that paradoxically Christians were better protected under Saddam's dictatorship.[5]\n[edit] Relations with Hindus\nEach year the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue sends a message, signed by its President, to Hindus for the feast of Diwali, which is celebrated during the month of October. In the 2009 message, Tauran called for the promotion of integral development, protection of human life and respect for the dignity and fundamental rights of the person.[6]\nThe Council sends similar messages each year on the occasion of the feasts of Eid ul-Fitr (Islam) and Vesak (Buddhism).\n[edit] Sharia\nIn a breakfast meeting with journalists, Tauran said Rowan Williams had been \u201cmistaken and naive\u201d for suggesting that some aspects of Sharia law in Britain were unavoidable.[7] He also said that he did not want an impression to grow that there are different classes of religion.[8]\n[edit] References\n\n^ a b c Whispers in the Loggia.

He later earned a doctorate in classics at the University of Perugia. He was ordained a priest for the diocese of Todi in 1960.\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Antonelli's coat-of-arms on the basilica of Sant'Andrea delle Fratte. His episcopal motto is Voluntas Dei pax nostra, \"The will of God is our peace\".\n\n\n[edit] Bishop\nHe eventually became rector of the Seminary of Perugia and a professor of classics in Assisi before being ordained a bishop in 1982, when Pope John Paul II named him to head the diocese of Gubbio. In 1988 he was advanced to Archbishop of Perugia-Citt\u00e0 del Pieve, from which see he stepped down in 1995 to become Secretary-General of the Italian Episcopal Conference.\n[edit] Cardinal\nHe served in this position until March 2001, when he was named to the see of Florence, whose archbishop is traditionally named a cardinal, and he was duly elevated in the consistory of 2003, becoming Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Andrea delle Fratte.\nHe resigned as Archbishop of Florence on 7 June 2008, on becoming President of the Pontifical Council for the Family.[1]\nOn 29 January 2011 Cardinal Antonelli was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants.\nCardinal Antonelli was considered an Italian papabile heading into the 2005 papal conclave in which Pope Benedict XVI was elected and at which Antonelli was a cardinal elector. Cardinal Antonelli remains eligible to vote in any future papal conclaves that occur before his 80th birthday on 18 November 2016. He retired as president of the Pontifical Council for the Family on 26 June 2012.[2]\nOn 15 September 2012 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints for a five-year term.[3]\n[edit] Views\nCardinal Antonelli is generally seen as a moderate, with a strong interest in social justice and peace issues. In response to demands that the Church denounce divorcees who were candidates for political office in the 1990s, he said the Church should be more concerned with their voting record.[4] When in 2009 the Italian Court of Cassation declared there was no substantial difference in law between a family based on marriage and one resulting from cohabitation, he reacted by saying that, in the light of recent sociological studies that reveal the benefits to society of what is called the traditional family and the disadvantages for society of single-parent families and those of cohabiting couples, the traditional family is needed more than ever today both for family members and for society as a whole.[5]\nIn January 2012 Bishop Demetrio Fernandez of Cordoba said there was a conspiracy by the United Nations. \"The Minister for Family of the Papal Government, Cardinal Antonelli, told me a few days ago in Zaragoza that UNESCO has a program for the next 20 years to make half the world population homosexual. To do this they have distinct programs, and will continue to implant the ideology that is already present in our schools.\"[6]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Nomina del Presidente del Pontificio Consiglio per la Famiglia\" (in Italian).

He is the Cardinal-Archbishop Emeritus of Bologna having served as archbishop from 1984 to 2003, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1985.\n[edit] Biography\nBiffi was born in Milan, and studied at the seminaries of the Archdiocese of Milan. He was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Archbishop Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster, O.S.B., on 23 December 1950. From 1951 to 1960, Biffi taught dogmatic theology at the Seminary of Milan, also publishing numerous works on theology, catechetics and meditation. He received a doctorate in theology from the Faculty of Theology at Venegono in 1955; his thesis was entitled: \"La colpa e la libert\u00e0 nell\u2019odierna condizione umana.\"\nFrom 1960 to 1975, he did pastoral work in the Archdiocese of Milan, serving as a parish priest at Santi Martiri Anauniani in Legnano (1960\u20131969) and later Sant'Andrea in Milan (1969\u20131975). Biffi became Episcopal Vicar for Culture in 1974, and a canon theologian of the metropolitan chapter of Milan on 1 February 1975. He also served as director of the Istituto Lombardo di Pastorale and the Commission for the Ambrosian Rite.\nOn 7 December 1975, Biffi was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Milan and Titular Bishop of Fidenae by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on 11 January 1976 from Cardinal Giovanni Colombo, with Bishops Bernardo Citterio and Libero Tresoldi serving as co-consecrators. Within the Italian Episcopal Conference, he served on commissions for doctrine, catechetics, culture and liturgy.\nFollowing the sudden death of Enrico Manfredini, Biffi was named Archbishop of Bologna on 19 April 1984, being installed as such on the following 1 June. He was later elected President of the Episcopal Conference of Emilia-Romagna on 7 July 1984. Pope John Paul II created him Cardinal-Priest of Santi Giovanni Evangelista e Petronio in the consistory of 25 May 1985. Biffi preached the Lent spiritual exercises for the pope and Roman Curia in 1989. He retired from the governance of the archdiocese in December 2003, being succeeded by Carlo Caffarra.\nBiffi was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. According to a leaked diary, he received one vote on the fourth ballot. In 2008, he turned 80 and lost the ability to participate in future conclaves.\n[edit] Views\nIn 2000, Biffi told a Bologna conference that the Antichrist would most likely be a prominent philanthropist promoting the ideas of ecumenism, vegetarianism, and pacifism.[1][2] Many of these predictions originate from the 19th century Russian philosopher Vladimir Solovyov, in whom Biffi is well-studied.[3] Biffi believes ecumenicism promotes the dilution of Catholic doctrine (a view common among conservative Catholics), thereby encouraging acceptance of the Antichrist.[4]\nHe also holds views that, while conservative, are in agreement with the Catholic teaching on homosexual acts, freemasonry, and feminism.[citation needed] Biffi has stated that an \"ideology of homosexuality\" threatens to marginalize whoever disagrees with the homosexual agenda,[5] and that Catholics must prepare for persecution by homosexual activists and their allies.[6]\nBiffi has stated that the Church should be \"exceedingly rich\", that clergy and parishioners should be accepting of the Church's wealth, and that Catholics should literally impoverish themselves donating to the church, thereby following Christ's example of poverty.[7]\nCardinal Biffi also once said that the Italian government should favour Catholic immigrants to offset the number of Muslim immigrants to protect Italy's \"national identity\".[8] He has denounced journalists as \"rats\".[6]\nIn 2007, Biffi published Memorie e digressioni di un italiano cardinale (Memoirs and digressions of an Italian cardinal), expounding on many of his views.[9]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Cardinal: Antichrist is a vegetarian\".

(born 2 December 1934) is an Italian prelate and a Vatican diplomat. A cardinal of the Catholic Church, he currently serves as Cardinal Secretary of State and Camerlengo, having previously served as Archbishop of Vercelli from 1991 to 1995, as Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, when Cardinal Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict XVI, was Prefect, and Archbishop of Genoa from 2002 to 2006. Bertone was elevated to the cardinalate in 2003. On 10 May 2008, he was named Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati. Besides his native Italian, Bertone speaks fluent French, Spanish, German and Portuguese. He has some knowledge of English, although he is not fluent, and he can read Polish, Latin, Greek and Hebrew.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life\n2 Archbishop and Cardinal\n3 Cardinal Secretary of State\n\n3.1 Evaluation of dicasteries\n3.2 Church and sports\n3.3 Defense of Pius XII\n3.4 Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy\n3.5 Comments by Patriarch Alexius II\n3.6 Le Figaro interview\n3.7 Proposed excommunication of drug dealers\n3.8 Support for universal and free access to anti-AIDS drugs\n3.9 Vatican leaks\n3.10 Ash Wednesday speech\n\n\n4 Criticisms\n\n4.1 Controversial statements on child abuse within the Church\n4.2 Political controversies in the Roman Curia\n4.3 Third Secret of Fatima controversy\n\n\n5 Awards and honors\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life\nBertone was born in Romano Canavese, Piedmont, the fifth of eight children. Bertone has stated that his mother was a determined anti-Fascist militant of the Italian People's Party, and later a Christian Democrat.\nHe professed his vows as a member of the Salesians on 3 December 1950, and was ordained a priest by Archbishop Albino Mensa on 1 July 1960. He holds a doctorate in canon law. His dissertation was entitled The Governance of the Church in the Thought of Pope Benedict XIV (1740\u20131758).[1] He served as Professor of Special Moral Theology at the Pontifical Salesian University from 1967 until his appointment as Professor of Canon Law in 1976, a post he held until 1991. He was a visiting professor of Public Ecclesiastical Law at the Institute Utriusque Iuris of the Pontifical Lateran University in 1978. In 1988 he was appointed to a group of experts that assisted Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in negotiations with the then-excommunicated Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. He was also commissioned by Pope John Paul II to assist Emmanuel Milingo, Archbishop Emeritus of Lusaka, Zambia, in returning to the Catholic Church in 2001. Milingo had left the Church to marry Maria Sung of the Moon sect.[2]\n[edit] Archbishop and Cardinal\nOn 4 July 1991, Bertone was appointed Archbishop of Vercelli by Pope John Paul II. He was consecrated bishop one month later by Archbishop Mensa, who had also ordained him. He held this post until his resignation in 1995 upon being named Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under Cardinal Ratzinger, who would later become Pope Benedict XVI. Appointed Archbishop of Genoa on 10 December 2002 and installed on 2 February 2003, Bertone was elevated to the College of Cardinals in the consistory of 21 October 2003, as Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria Ausiliatrice in Via Tuscolana. Then-Archbishop Angelo Amato succeeded Bertone as Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, before becoming the Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.\nAs a member of the Society of Don Bosco, he is considered a priest who has undertaken work with youth whom, in Pope John Paul's last words, he had sought throughout his papacy. Bertone's secretary once related a story that \"Bertone once decided to take a public bus to the Apostolic Palace. As the Cardinal in his long black cassock and red fascia strode on to the bus, the people, especially a group of young people, stared in silence. Bertone immediately broke the ice with his 'characteristic' smile. By the time he reached his destination the prelate had engaged the youth in a deep conversation on love, sex, virginity, and chastity\".[3]\nHe later specialized in the relationship between social morality, faith and politics. He also assisted with the revision of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, and undertook pastoral work in parishes. In the Jubilee Year 2000, Cardinal Bertone was entrusted by John Paul II with the publication of the third part of the secret of Fatima.\nBertone was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Bertone is eligible to vote in the 2013 conclave and any future conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on 2 December 2014.\nOn 15 March 2005, Bertone was in the news for \"breaking the Church's silence\" and sharply criticizing Dan Brown's 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code, saying the book was \"shameful and unfounded lies\", and that believers should boycott the book. Both Bertone and official Vatican spokespeople insisted that Bertone was not speaking as an official representative of the Church, but it was also noted that Bertone's high placement within the Church hierarchy (his name was often cited as a potential candidate for the next pontiff) gave his words considerable weight, such that his comments were often reported by various media as an official statement from the Vatican.[4] In 2006, the NBC news program Dateline described his statement as \"a high-ranking Vatican Cardinal called for a boycott of the film.\"\n[edit] Cardinal Secretary of State\n\n\nStyles of\nTarcisio Bertone, SDB\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nFrascati (Suburbicarian)\n\n\nOn 22 June 2006, Benedict XVI appointed Cardinal Bertone to replace Angelo Sodano as the Cardinal Secretary of State, assuming the office on 15 September of that same year. On 26 June 2006 Cardinal Bertone was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.[5]\nIt was revealed on the following 31 August that Cardinal Bertone had a dream in which Pope John Paul II spoke to him saying \"do not be afraid\" to the Cardinal as he prepared to take his new job.[6]\nOn 4 April 2007, Benedict XVI also appointed Cardinal Bertone as Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church (or Chamberlain). The duties of the Camerlengo are largely confined to administration during the vacancy of the Holy See.[7] On 10 May 2008 he was promoted to the rank of Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati.[8]\nBertone is known to study the problem at hand before taking action. One such example is when after he was named Archbishop of Vercelli he \"locked himself in his room all night and studied the life of Saint Eusebius, who was bishop of the city back in 345 AD\".[3]\nHe is a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Congregation for the Clergy, Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Congregation for the Oriental Churches, Congregation for Bishops and Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. He will hold these memberships until his 80th birthday on 2 December 2014.\n[edit] Evaluation of dicasteries\nTwo weeks before entering office, Bertone was interviewed and asked his opinion about reforms of the Roman Curia. Bertone remarked, \"After almost two decades, an evaluation of how the dicasteries are organised is more than comprehensible, in order to reflect on how to make the existing structures more efficient for the mission of the Church and eventually to consider whether all of them should be maintained\".[9]\n[edit] Church and sports\nCardinal Bertone suggested in December 2006 that the Holy See \"could, in future, field a team that plays at the top level, with Roma, Internazionale, Genoa and Sampdoria.\" He continued by saying, \"If we just take the Brazilian students from our Pontifical universities we could have a magnificent squad\".[10] However, only hours later he said, \"I've got much more to do than cultivating a football squad for the Vatican\", and explained that his earlier remark was not intended to be taken seriously.[11]\n[edit] Defense of Pius XII\nOn 5 June 2007, at a conference announcing the release of a new biography of Pope Pius XII, Bertone defended Pius against claims of indifference toward the Jews during The Holocaust. The Cardinal condemned this accusation as a \"black legend\" and \"an attack on good sense and on rationality\", which has \"become so firmly established that even to scratch it is an arduous task\".[12] Although he admitted that Pius XII had been \"cautious\" in condemning Nazi Germany, Bertone stated that Nazi forces would have intensified its program of genocide had the Pope been more outspoken.\n[edit] Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy\nSee also: Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy\nOn 16 September 2006, Cardinal Bertone, after only one day in his job as Cardinal Secretary of State, released a declaration explaining that the \"position of the Pope concerning Islam is unequivocally that expressed by the conciliar document Nostra Aetate\" and that \"the Pope's option in favour of inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue is equally unequivocal.\"[13]\n\nAs for the opinion of the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus which he quoted during his Regensburg talk, the Holy Father did not mean, nor does he mean, to make that opinion his own in any way. He simply used it as a means to undertake\u2014in an academic context, and as is evident from a complete and attentive reading of the text\u2014certain reflections on the theme of the relationship between religion and violence in general, and to conclude with a clear and radical rejection of the religious motivation for violence, from whatever side it may come. [The Pope] sincerely regrets that certain passages of his address could have sounded offensive to the sensitivities of the Muslim faithful and should have been interpreted in a manner that in no way corresponds to his intentions.[14][15] (emphasis as in original)\n\n[edit] Comments by Patriarch Alexius II\nOn 5 December 2006, Patriarch Alexius II accused the Holy See of an \"extremely unfriendly policy\"[16] when he said that the Catholic Church was poaching converts in Orthodox lands in Russia and other ex-Soviet republics. In response, Cardinal Bertone said, \"We do not want to engage in proselytism in Russia\".[17]\n[edit] Le Figaro interview\nOn 31 March 2007, Cardinal Bertone confirmed Pope Benedict's impending publication of the long-expected motu proprio extending the indult for the celebration of the Tridentine Mass in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro.[18][19][20]\nIn the same interview, Bertone \"blasted the media for highlighting the Vatican's views on sex while maintaining a 'deafening silence' about charity work done by thousands of Catholic organisations around the world.\"[21] He continued by saying, \"I see a fixation by some journalists on moral topics, such as abortion and homosexual unions, which are certainly important issues but absolutely do not constitute the thinking and work of the Church.\"\n[edit] Proposed excommunication of drug dealers\nOn 14 January 2009, Cardinal Bertone suggested that the Church would consider taking much stronger action against drug dealers. This action might possibly include excommunication. He made a statement about the Church's alarm at the \"disaster\" of drug-fuelled violence on the eve of a trip to Mexico. [4]\n[edit] Support for universal and free access to anti-AIDS drugs\nOn Friday, June 22, 2012, in an online news story article by Cindy Wooden of Catholic News Service (CNS), it was reported that, in a conference in Rome on the prevention of the transmission of AIDS from mothers to children sponsored by the lay Community of Sant'Egidio (which runs the DREAM project, a free AIDS prevention/treatment program in 10 African countries), the Cardinal Secretary of State urged that full and easy access to antiretroviral drugs be made free worldwide (these are drugs, such as AZT, that can treat, and in some cases, can prevent people from getting, AIDS; they do not presently cure AIDS once it has infected someone). Cardinal Bertone acknowledged that the only way this would be remotely feasible, especially in Africa- where the efforts would be most needed and focused- would be through a collaborative effort involving aid groups, governments, donors, medical groups, pharmaceutical companies, and churches.[22]\n[edit] Vatican leaks\nSee also: Vatileaks\nCardinal Bertone is the main target of much of the leaks in the Roman Curia. Cardinal Bertone blamed the scandal over leaked Vatican documents on unethical journalists and a spirit of hostility toward the Catholic Church. \"Many journalists play at imitating Dan Brown,\" said Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, in an interview with the Italian magazine Famiglia Cristiana. \"They continue to invent fables or repeat legends.\" Cardinal Bertone made his remarks as Vatican judges were investigating leaks to Italian journalists of dozens of documents, including letters to the pope and encrypted cables from Vatican embassies around the world, several of which hint at power struggles among officials of the Holy See. \"The truth is that there is a malicious will to produce division\" among the collaborators of Pope Benedict XVI, he said.[23]\n[edit] Ash Wednesday speech\nOn 13 February 2013, at the last public Mass of Pope Benedict XVI before his resignation would take effect on 28 February, Cardinal Bertone praised Pope Benedict, \"We would not be honest, Your Holiness, if we said that this evening there is not a hint of sadness in our hearts. In recent years, your teaching has been a window open onto the Church and the world, which let in the rays of truth and love of God, to enlighten and warm our journey, even and especially at times when clouds gathered in the sky\". Cardinal Bertone went on to say \"All of us have realized that it is precisely the deep love that Your Holiness has for God and the Church that prompted you to make this act, revealing that purity of mind, that strong and demanding faith, that strength of humility and meekness, along with great courage, that have marked every step of your life and your ministry\".[24]\n[edit] Criticisms\n[edit] Controversial statements on child abuse within the Church\nIn his book The Case Of The Pope, Geoffrey Robertson criticises Bertone for his hyperbolic rejection of the \"demand that a bishop be obligated to contact police to denounce a priest who had admitted paedophilia\". Bertone argued that \"if a priest cannot confide in his bishop for fear of being denounced then it would mean that there is no more liberty of conscience\". As recently as Easter 2010, Bertone has publicly blamed the child sex scandal on homosexual infiltration of the clergy.\n[edit] Political controversies in the Roman Curia\nBertone has been criticized by Catholic journalist Sandro Magister for having exposed Benedict XVI to public controversies surrounding episcopal nominations in Italy and Poland.[25] Magister also writes that the problems in communications and governance that were visible during the Williamson affair can largely be attributed to Bertone.[26]\n[edit] Third Secret of Fatima controversy\nMain article: Third Secret of Fatima controversy\nBertone has been accused of lying about the content of the Third Secret of Fatima in his book, The Last Secret of Fatima,[27] and also in televised appearances.[28][29] After Bertone's book was published, Italian journalist Antonio Socci published an article entitled, Dear Cardinal Bertone: Who\u2014between you and me\u2014is Deliberately Lying?.[28] Catholic attorney Christopher Ferrara wrote an entire book called The Secret Still Hidden (content available online) aimed at exposing and debunking the claims of Cardinal Bertone with respect to Fatima.[29] The book contains an appendix entitled, 101 Grounds for Doubting Cardinal Bertone's Account. In particular, it is claimed that Bertone engaged in a systematic deception along with Cardinal Sodano and Cardinal Ratzinger to cover-up the existence of a one-page document containing the words L\u00facia Santos said were relayed to her in a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which some believe contains information about the Apocalypse and a great apostasy.[29][30] Bertone denied that he told anything less than the full truth about Fatima in a televised appearance.[31]\n[edit] Awards and honors\nIn February 2010 President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski of Poland conferred on the cardinal the country's highest decoration for foreign nationals, the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of Poland, \"for the lofty merits acquired in the development of the collaboration between the Republic of Poland and the Holy See and for the work carried out in favor of the Church in Poland.\"\nCardinal Bertone also received the Gaudium et Spes Award at the Knights of Columbus Supreme Convention in 2007. It is the order's highest honor.[32]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Zenit.

He served as Patriarch of Venice from 1978 to 2002, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1979.\n[edit] Biography\nBorn in Izano, C\u00e9 studied at the seminary in Crema, at the Lodi lyceum, and at the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome. From the Gregorian he obtained a doctorate in dogmatic theology and a licentiate in Sacred Scripture. C\u00e9 was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Luigi Traglia on 27 March 1948 in the Lateran Basilica. He then returned to Crema, where he served as Professor of Scripture and vice-rector of the seminary from 1948 to 1957, being named rector in 1950.\nOn 22 April 1970, C\u00e9 was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Bologna and Titular Bishop of Vulturia. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 17 May from Bishop Carlo Manziana, with Archbishop Franco Costa and Bishop Placido Cambiaghi, CRSP, serving as co-consecrators. On 21 May 1976, he was made a chaplain to Azione Cattolica.\nAfter the ascension of Pope John Paul I to the papacy and his death thirty-three days later, C\u00e9 was named his successor as Patriarch of Venice by Pope John Paul II on 7 December 1978. He was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Marco by John Paul II in the consistory of 30 June 1979. C\u00e9 resigned as Patriarch on 5 January 2002, and was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XVI. In 2006, he was invited by Pope Benedict to preach the Lenten spiritual exercises to him and the Roman Curia.\n[edit] External links\n\nCardinals of the Holy Roman Church\nCatholic-Pages\nCatholic-Hierarchy\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAlbino Luciani\nPatriarch of Venice\n1978\u20132002\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nAngelo Scola\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 89494164\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nCe, Marco\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n8 July 1925\n\n\nPlace of birth\n\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 3115/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 30249/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 17037/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 4973/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 20/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1733102-0!*!0!!*!4!* and timestamp 20130226111722 ", "Name": "Marco C\u00e9"}, {"url": "/wiki/Salvatore_De_Giorgi", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0\nSalvatore De Giorgi\n\n\nArchbishop Emeritus of Palermo\n\n\nArchdiocese\nPalermo\n\n\nSee\nPalermo\n\n\nAppointed\n4 April 1996\n\n\nReign ended\n19 December 2006\n\n\nPredecessor\nSalvatore Pappalardo\n\n\nSuccessor\nPaolo Romeo\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nOrdination\n28 June 1953\nby\u00a0Francesco Minerva\n\n\nConsecration\n27 December 1973\nby\u00a0Francesco Minerva\n\n\nCreated Cardinal\n21 February 1998\n\n\nRank\nCardinal-Priest\n\n\nPersonal details\n\n\nBorn\n(1930-09-06) 6 September 1930 (age\u00a082)\nVerole, Italy\n\n\nNationality\nItalian\n\n\nDenomination\nRoman Catholic\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\n\nAuxiliary Bishop of Oria (1973-1975)\nTitular Bishop of Tulana (1973-1978)\nCoadjutor Bishop of Oria (1975-1978)\nBishop of Oria (1978-1981)\nArchbishop of Foggia (1981-1986)\nBishop of Bovino (1981-1986)\nBishop of Troia (1981-1986)\nArchbishop of Foggia-Bovino (1986-1987)\nArchbishop of Taranto (1987-1990)\n\n\n\n\n\nMotto\nin charitate pax\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\n\nSalvatore De Giorgi (born 6 September 1930) is an Italian churchman, Archbishop Emeritus of Palermo in Sicily.\nDe Giorgi was born in Vernole, in Apulia (Southern Italy).

He was educated at the Minor Seminary in Potenza and later at the Pontifical Regional Seminary, Salerno and finally at the Pontifical Inter-regional Seminary, Posillipo. He was ordained to the priesthood. on 5 July 1953. He served from 1953-1971 successively in the diocese of Anglona-Tursi as pastor; director of the center for social studies; diocesan assistant of the Catholic Action; professor of religion; vicar general. He was created Chaplain of His Holiness on 23 February 1968.\nIn 1971 Pope Paul VI named him as the Titular Bishop of Lari Castello and the Auxiliary Bishop of Matera, and, in 1974, as the Archbishop of Matera; it was eventually renamed as the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Matera-Irsina. He obtained the title of Metropolitan Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Naples in 1987. The following year John Paul II created him Cardinal-Priest of San Gioacchino ai Prati di Castello. He retired in May 2006, and was succeeded by Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe. Cardinal Giordano was admitted in the \"Monaldi\" hospital in Naples with respiratory problems and died a week later on Thursday 2 December 2010, at age 80. In the papal telegram of condolence sent on Friday 3 December 2010 to Cardinal Sepe, Pope Benedict XVI offered prayers for the repose of his soul and the Apostolic Blessing to all those in mourning, stating that he learned of the prelate's death \"with great sadness.\"\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Cardinal Giordano\n\n\n[edit] References\n[3]\n\n\n^ http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios-g.htm#Giordano\n^ http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bgiordano.html\n^ http://www.cardinalrating.com/cardinal_35.htm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 166605467\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nGiordano, Michele\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n26 September 1930\n\n\nPlace of birth\nSan Angelo, Italy\n\n\nDate of death\n2 December 2010\n\n\nPlace of death\nNaples, Italy\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article about a Catholic archbishop is a stub.

He was Archbishop of Milan from 1980 to 2002 and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1983.\nMartini entered the Society of Jesus in 1944 and was ordained a priest in 1952. His appointment as Archbishop of Milan in 1980 was an unusual circumstance, as Jesuits are not traditionally named bishops. He was on the liberal wing of the church hierarchy. Suffering from a rare form of Parkinson's Disease, he retired as Archbishop in 2002 and moved to the Pontifical Institute in Jerusalem. He died at the Jesuit Aloisianum College in Gallarate near Milan.\nHours after his death, the Italian daily Corriere della Sera printed his final interview in which he described the Church as \"200 years out of date.\" \"Our culture has aged, our churches are big and empty and the church bureaucracy rises up. The Church must admit its mistakes and begin a radical change, starting from the Pope and the bishops. The pedophilia scandals oblige us to take a journey of transformation.\"[1]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Career\n3 Death and funeral\n4 Views\n\n4.1 Dominus Iesus\n4.2 Contraception\n4.3 Beginning of human life\n4.4 Right to refuse treatments\n4.5 Collegiality of bishops\n4.6 Role of women in the Church\n4.7 Sacramentum Caritatis\n4.8 Social work\n4.9 Catholic schools\n4.10 Same-sex unions\n\n\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and education\nCarlo Maria Martini was born 15 February 1927 in Orbassano in the Province of Turin, Piedmont, to Leonardo, an engineer, and Olga (n\u00e9e Maggia) Martini. He was baptized on the following 22 February. He was educated at Istituto Sociale, a school run by Jesuits in Turin. He entered the Society of Jesus on 25 September 1944 and was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Maurilio Fossati on 13 July 1952. Martini completed his studies in philosophy at the Jesuits' House of Studies in Gallarate, in the province of Milan, and theology at the faculty of theology in Chieri.\nIn 1958, Martini was awarded his doctorate in fundamental theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University, with a thesis exploring the problems of the Resurrection accounts. After some years of teaching at the faculty of Chieri, he returned to Rome and earned another doctorate in Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute, graduating summa cum laude, with a thesis on a group of codices of the Gospel of Luke.\n[edit] Career\nAfter completing his studies, Martini quickly pursued a successful academic career. In 1962, he was given the Chair of Textual Criticism at the Pontifical Biblical Institute, a specialist institute of the Gregorian, and became its rector in 1969. In 1978, under Pope Paul VI, he was elected the Pontifical Gregorian University's rector magnificus, serving in this post from 1969 to 1978, after which he was nominated chancellor of the Pontifical Gregorian University. Throughout these years, he edited a number of scholarly works. Martini became active in the scientific field by publishing various books and articles. Furthermore he received the honour of being the only Catholic member of the ecumenical committee that prepared the new Greek edition of the New Testament, the Novum Testamentum Graece. Martini is remembered for his books on spiritual exercises which have added a renewed style to the original Ignatian model.[citation needed]\nOn 29 December 1979, Pope John Paul II appointed Martini as Archbishop of Milan, receiving his episcopal consecration from the Pope himself the following 6 January, with Archbishop Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Somalo and Bishop Ferdinando Maggioni serving as co-consecrators. Thus his first diocesan appointment was to one of the largest and most prominent sees. In the consistory of 2 February 1983, he was assigned the title of Cardinal Priest of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. The motto he chose for his coat of arms is translated as \"\u201cFor the love of truth, dare to choose adverse situations\".\nMartini served as Relator of the 6th General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in 1983. Martini later served as president of the European Bishops' Conference between 1987 and 1993.\nIn 1996, he was presented with an honorary doctorate from the Russian Academy of Sciences. In Spain in October 2000, he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences. Martini was admitted as a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in November 2000.\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Martini in 1992\n\n\nIn 2002, Martini reached the Catholic Church's mandatory retirement age of 75 and was succeeded in Milan by Dionigi Tettamanzi. At the time of the 2005 conclave, he was 78 years old and hence eligible to vote for the new Pope (being under 80). For years many progressive Catholics harboured hopes that he himself might eventually ascend the papacy, but when John Paul II died, most commentators believed that his election was unlikely, given his liberal reputation and apparent frailty.[2] Nevertheless, according to La Stampa (an Italian newspaper), he obtained more votes than Joseph Ratzinger during the first round of the election (40 vs. 38). Conversely, an anonymous cardinal's diary stated that he never mustered more than a dozen or so votes, in contrast to another Jesuit cardinal, Jorge Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, and quickly withdrew his candidacy.[3] Upon reaching the age of 80 on 15 February 2007, Martini lost his right to vote in future conclaves.\nAfter his retirement, Martini moved to the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Jerusalem to continue his work as a biblical scholar. He returned to Milan in 2008 where he spent his final years in a Jesuit house.\n[edit] Death and funeral\nMartini died in Gallarate on 31 August 2012. According to an online Zenit news statement about his death, Pope Benedict XVI, in his formal message of condolence sent by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican Secretary of State, praised Martini's strength during his struggle with Parkinson's, his long service as Archbishop of Milan and his work as a scholar of the Bible.[4] The Mayor of Milan, Giuliano Pisapia led the tributes by saying, \"Carlo Maria Martini illuminated the way for the entire city, not just for part of it. For this reason, today more than ever, Milan mourns its Archbishop.\"[5]\nMore than 150,000 people passed before Martini's casket in the metropolitan cathedral of Milan before the Requiem Mass, following the Ambrosian rite, on 3 September.[6] At the beginning of the ceremony, the representative of Pope Benedict, Angelo Cardinal Comastri, vicar general of the Vatican City, read a message.[7][8] Cardinal Scola presided over the concelebrated Mass and delivered the homily. At the end of the Mass, Cardinal Tettamanzi read his remembrance. Concelebrating with Cardinal Scola were Cardinals Comastri, Tettamanzi, Bagnasco, Piovanelli, Romeo and Ravasi. Also present were the sister of Martini, Maris, his niece Giulia and his nephew Giovanni. In attendance were Father Adolfo Nicol\u00e1s SJ, superior general of the Society of Jesus, and representatives of other Christian denominations and the Jewish and Muslim communities. The Italian government was represented by Mario Monti and his wife.[9]\nIn a private ceremony Martini was then buried in an empty tomb on the left side of the cathedral facing the main altar.\n[edit] Views\nOften considered to be one of the more liberal members of the College of Cardinals, and prelates in general, he achieved widespread notice for his writings, earning him popularity in some circles, criticism in others. On occasion Martini's views proved to be controversial, thus bringing him comparatively large amounts of media coverage. In the final interview he gave, shortly before his death, he urged major reforms to the Catholic Church, calling it \"200 years out of date\" and arguing that, \"Our culture has aged, our churches are big and empty and the church bureaucracy rises up, our rituals and our cassocks are pompous\".[10]\nMartini was known to be progressive on matters concerning human relationships, the possible ordination of women to the diaconate and some bioethical questions, notably contraceptive use in certain more complex situations.[11]\n[edit] Dominus Iesus\nIn 2000. he criticized Dominus Iesus, a declaration by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that the Catholic Church is the sole true Church of Christ, and described the document as \"theologically rather dense, peppered with quotations, and not easy to grasp\".[12]\n[edit] Contraception\nIn April 2006, in response to a very specific question from physician and politician Ignazio Marino, director of the transplant centre of the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Martini opined that in certain cases, the usage of condoms might be allowable stating, \"The use of condoms can, in certain situations, be a lesser evil\".[13] He stressed the particular case of married couples where one has HIV or AIDS.[14] But he quickly noted that it's one thing the principle of the lesser evil in such cases, and quite another the subject who has to convey those things publicly, thus it is not up to the Church authorities to support condom use publicly, because of \"the risk of promoting an irresponsible attitude\". The Church is more likely to support other morally sustainable means, such as abstinence.[15] On another occasion, the Cardinal stated that \"I believe the Church's teaching has not been expressed so well... I am confident we will find some formula to state things better, so that the problem is better understood and more adapted to reality,\" earning him a reputation for having a more liberal stance toward contraception.[16]\n[edit] Beginning of human life\nMartini's position on the start of a distinct human life during the fertilization of oocytes was rebuked by certain Vatican officials.[17] Some of his other positions may have frustrated Church leaders, but official response from the Roman Curia was limited.\n[edit] Right to refuse treatments\nCardinal Martini, speaking about the right to die debate, said that \"terminally ill patients should be given the right to refuse treatments and that the doctors who assist them should be protected by law.\"[18][dead link] It is traditional Catholic moral teaching that one is morally bound to apply \"ordinary\" treatments, but not \"extraordinary\" treatments.[19][20] The distinction was the basis of the declaration by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1980 that, \"when inevitable death is imminent in spite of the means used, it is permitted in conscience to take the decision to refuse forms of treatment that would only secure a precarious and burdensome prolongation of life, so long as the normal care due to the sick person in similar cases is not interrupted.\"[21] The Catechism of the Catholic Church also states: \"Discontinuing medical procedures that are burdensome, dangerous, extraordinary, or disproportionate to the expected outcome can be legitimate\".[22] Martini, in fact, refused medical treatment[specify] as his illness advanced.[citation needed]\n[edit] Collegiality of bishops\nMartini called for greater collegiality in the governance of the Church and urged continued reflection on the structure and exercise of ecclesiastical authority.[23]\n[edit] Role of women in the Church\nHe demonstrated a desire for further theological enquiry on issues relating to human sexuality and the role of women in the Church. He expressed support for the ordination of female deacons.[24]\n[edit] Sacramentum Caritatis\nIn March 2007, he openly criticised the attitude of the Church authorities; while speaking at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem to a congregation of over 1,300 visitors, he remarked that \"The Church does not give orders.\" Martini stated that \"It is necessary to listen to others, and when speaking to use terms that they understand.\" These remarks came days after Pope Benedict XVI published the 140-page apostolic exhortation Sacramentum Caritatis. Some interpreted this document as being an attempt to influence Catholic politicians, particularly at a time when Italian government was trying to pass legislation offering legal recognition of same sex unions.[25]\n[edit] Social work\nFurthermore, he promoted combating social ills, often calling for greater action to be taken in assisting socially underprivileged. Martini wished that the Church rekindle a \"burning fire in the heart\" of men and women today.\n[edit] Catholic schools\nMartini was a stringent supporter of Catholic schools and many times he spoke in favour of state contribution to Catholic schools. He said that one hour a week of teaching of Catholic religion in the Italian high school was not enough and the time dedicated to religious teaching in the school had to be increased.\n[edit] Same-sex unions\nIn his book Credere e conoscere, published shortly before his death, Martini set out his disagreement with the Catholic teaching against homosexual civil unions. \u201cI disagree with the positions of those in the Church, that take issue with civil unions\u201d, he wrote. \u201cIt is not bad, instead of casual sex between men, that two people have a certain stability\u201d and that the \u201cstate could recognize them.\u201d Although he stated his belief that \"the homosexual couple, as such, can never be totally equated to a marriage\", he also said that he could understand (although not necessarily approve of) gay pride parades when they support the need for self-affirmation.[26]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ The Independent, 3 September 2012\n^ Wakin, Daniel J.

He served as Vicar General of the Diocese of Rome from 1991 to 2008 [1]. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1991.\nHe was very active in the mass media and was one of the cardinals who most often appeared on Italian television, newspapers and magazines. On 14 February 2006, he was confirmed as president of the Italian Episcopal Conference by Pope Benedict XVI a post at which he served until March 2007.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Biography\n2 Politics\n3 Retirement\n4 References\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Biography\nRuini was born in Sassuolo, Emilia-Romagna. Having studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, he obtained a licentiate in philosophy and a licentiate in sacred theology.\nHe was ordained to the priesthood on 8 December 1954, by Archbishop Luigi Traglia. In 1957 he returned to Reggio Emilia and taught philosophy at the diocesan seminary until 1968. From 1958 to 1966 he served as chaplain to university graduates and from 1966 to 1970 he served as a delegate for Azione Cattolica.\nAmong his teaching posts, from 1968 until 1986 he taught dogmatic theology at the Studio Teologico Interdiocesano of Modena-Reggio Emilia-Carpi-Guastalla, where he was also headmaster from 1968 to 1977.\nOn 16 May 1983, he was named auxiliary bishop of Reggio Emilia and titular bishop of Nepte, and was consecrated a bishop by Bishop Gilberto Baroni the following 29 June. As vice president of the Preparatory Committee, he contributed to the realization of the Ecclesial Convention of Loreto (1985), which has become a reference point in the dialogue between the Church and Italian society following the wounds of the 1960s and 1970s.\nIn June 1986 the Pope John Paul II named him secretary-general of the Italian bishops' conference. From 1988 to 2011 he was a consultor of the Congregation for Bishops.\nIn January 1991 he was named auxiliary bishop and pro-vicar general for the Diocese of Rome. In March 1991 he became president of the Italian bishops' conference. He was elevated to Cardinal-Priest of the Title of Sant'Agnese fuori le mura in June 1991, and was named vicar general of His Holiness for the Diocese of Rome and archpriest of the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano in July 1991. He was also grand chancellor of the Lateran University and Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family.\n\n\n\n\nCoat of Arms of Cardinal Ruini.\n\n\nIn addition to serving as the Cardinal Vicar, Cardinal Ruini served in the Roman Curia as a member of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pontifical Council for the Laity, the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See, and the Council of Cardinals for the Study of Organizational and Economic Affairs of the Holy See. He held these memberships until the 80th birthday in 2011.\nRuini was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. Ruini is no longer eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves following a pope's death. He celebrated his 80th birthday on 19 February 2011.\nOn 17 March 2010 the Vatican announced that it has formed a commission to look into the phenomenon of Medjugorje, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where six young people have said they have had visions of Mary since the early 80s. The international investigative commission on Medjugorje has been constituted, under the presidency of Cardinal Ruini and dependent upon the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\nRuini received accolades for his tireless efforts and unitary vision in the making of the documentary of Pope John Paul II.\n[edit] Politics\nRuini was seen as a conservative, close to the positions of Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI. He was very active in the mass media, and was the strongest voice of the Church against the spring 2005 referendum for the abolition of parts of Italy's laws on artificial insemination. He commented, like Pope Benedict XVI, upon the issue of the 1999 French Pacte civil de solidarit\u00e9 for unmarried couples of the same or opposite sex. In 2007 a bill was proposed in the Italian Senate for a law on civil unions.

He was appointed Archbishop of Milan by Pope Benedict XVI on 28 June 2011.[1] He had served as Patriarch of Venice since 2002. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 2003. He is considered a contender to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, who has announced his resignation effective 28 February 2013.[2]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early life\n1.2 Bishop of Grosseto\n1.3 Rector of Lateran University and offices in Roman Curia\n1.4 Patriarch of Venice\n1.5 Archbishop of Milan\n\n\n2 Works\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Biography\n[edit] Early life\nScola was born in Malgrate, Milan, to Carlo Scola, a truck driver,[3] and Regina Colombo. He was the younger of two sons; Pietro, his elder brother, died in 1983. He attended high school at the Manzoni Lyceum in Lecco,[3] where he participated in the youth movement Giovent\u00f9 Studentesca (Student Youth).\nHe studied philosophy at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart from 1964 to 1967, obtaining his doctorate with a dissertation on Christian philosophy. During this time served as Vice-President and thereafter President of the Milanese diocesan chapter of the Federazione Universitaria Cattolica Italiana, the university student wing of Catholic Action.\nAt the university Scola met Luigi Giussani, the founder of the Catholic movement Communion and Liberation. After earning his decree in philosophy and have taught in high schools, Scola decided to became a priest and entered in the Archiepiscopal seminary of Milan, studying one year in Saronno and the others in Venegono. In 1969 Scola asked to the Seminary of Venegono to be ordained Subdeacon ahead of time but he was not allowed to. Following the advice of Luigi Giussani, in summer 1969 Scola moved to the seminary of the Diocese of Teramo-Atri where he studied one year.[4] On 18 July 1970 Scola was ordained to the priesthood in Teramo by Bishop Abele Conigli.\nHe then attained a second doctorate in theology from the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. He wrote his dissertation on the works of St. Thomas Aquinas. An active collaborator in the Communion and Liberation movement from the early 1970s, Scola was the Italian editor of the journal Communio founded by Henri de Lubac, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Joseph Ratzinger (later to become Pope Benedict XVI).[3] He conducted book-length interviews with de Lubac and von Balthasar.[3]\nAfter periods of study in Munich and Paris and time spent in pastoral work, Scola returned to Fribourg to work as research assistant to the chair of political philosophy at Friburg from 1979 and thereafter Assistant Professor of Fundamental Moral Theology, a position he held until 1982 when he was appointed Professor of Theological Anthropology at the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family in Rome and Professor of Contemporary Christology at the Pontifical Lateran University.\nHe founded the Studium Generale Marcianum, an academic institute, and the journal Oasis, published in Italian, English, French, Arabic and Urdu as an outreach to Christians in the Muslim world.[3]\nFrom 1986 to 1991 Scola served the Roman Curia as consultor to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. At the various institutes where he taught he promoted the establishment of bursaries to enable foreign students, particularly those from poorer countries, to study in Italy.\n[edit] Bishop of Grosseto\nScola was named Bishop of Grosseto on 18 July 1991, and was consecrated by Cardinal Bernardin Gantin (with Bishops Abele Conigli and Adelmo Tacconi serving as co-consecrators) on the following 21 September. As Bishop of Grosseto he promoted a renewal of catechesis in the diocese. Scola chose as his episcopal motto Sufficit gratia tua (\"Your grace suffices\", 2 Corinthians 12:9).\nAmong Scola's chief pastoral concerns in Grosseto were the education of children and youths, vocations and clergy formation (he reopened the diocesan seminary), new approaches to parish life, the pastoral care of labourers (particularly during the difficult period of the dismantling of mines in Grosseto), culture and the family, and the opening of a diocesan mission in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. During this period he wrote and published a book aimed at young people on the subject of the educative mission of the Church. In his pastoral capacity as bishop, Scola paid particular attention to the issues of education, youth, clergy formation, renewal of parish life, pastoral care of workers, culture and the family.\n[edit] Rector of Lateran University and offices in Roman Curia\n\n\n\n\nArms of Cardinal Scola of Venice\n\n\nScola in 1995 resigned as bishop of Grosseto to serve as rector of the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome and President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family in Rome, with a term spent as visiting professor at the counterpart Institute in Washington, D.C., during which time he wrote a monograph on the theology of von Balthasar.\nIn 1995 he became a member of the Congregation for the Clergy. He also served as member of the Episcopal Commission for Catholic Education of the Italian Bishops' Conference and, from 1996, as president of the Committee for Institutes of Religious Studies which addresses questions of the theological formation of the laity in Italy.\nFrom 1996 to 2001 Scola was a member of the Pontifical Council for Health Workers and wrote several texts on issues around health care. In 1996 he was named a member to the Pontifical Council for the Family.\nOn 17 January 2009 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture by Pope Benedict.[5] On 5 January 2011 he was appointed among the first members of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.[6] He is also a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship.\n[edit] Patriarch of Venice\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Scola blessing the faithful with the Blessed Sacrament in Venice, 2005.\n\n\nScola was appointed Patriarch of Venice on 5 January 2002, elected President of the Bishops' Conference of the Triveneta region on 9 April 2002 and created Cardinal-Priest of Santi XII Apostoli on 21 October 2003. As patriarch Scola developed a reputation of openness and pastoral concern. In Venice, for instance, he set aside Wednesday mornings to meet anyone who wanted to see him, whether or not they had an appointment.[7]\nAfter the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Scola was considered to be among the papabili in the 2005 papal conclave.[3] Sr\u0111a Trifkovi\u0107 supported him vigorously in Chronicles because he saw him as the only man who might reverse what Vatican insiders see as the decay of European culture. The conclave elected Joseph Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Archbishop of Milan\nOn 28 June 2011 he was appointed to replace Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi as Archbishop of Milan, and he left the office of Patriarch of Venice. On 9 September 2011 he took possession of the Archdiocese of Milan by proxy, becoming the Archbishop of Milan to all intents and purposes.[8] Cardinal Scola received from Pope Benedict XVI the pallium of Metropolitan Archbishop of Milan on 21 September 2011 at Castel Gandolfo. The new Archbishop entered the city of Milan on 25 September 2011 and on that date he was enthroned in his Cathedral with a solemn Mass for the beginning of his pastoral ministry in the See of Milan.[9]\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Scola during a Liturgy in Cassano Magnago, 2012.\n\n\nOn Monday, 24 October 2011, Pope Benedict XVI named Cardinal Scola to be a member of the Council of Cardinals for the Study of the Organizational and Economic Problems of the Holy See.[10] On 7 March 2012 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.[11] On the 21 April he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\n[edit] Works\nScola is the author of numerous theological and pedagogical works on topics such as bio-medical ethics, theological anthropology, human sexuality and marriage and the family, which have been translated into several languages. In addition, he is the author of more than 120 articles published in scholarly journals of philosophy and theology.\n\nPublished works\n\n\nHans Urs Von Balthasar: A Theological Style.

Previous to his service in Milan, Tettamanzi was Archbishop of Genoa.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early years\n1.2 Bishop\n\n\n2 Social teaching\n3 References\n4 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Biography\n[edit] Early years\nTettamanzi was born in Renate, then in the province of Milan (now in the province of Monza and Brianza).\nHe was educated at the Minor Seminary of Seveso and the Seminary of Venegono Inferiore and finally at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome where he earned a doctorate in theology.\nAfter studying in local seminaries, he was ordained a priest on 28 June 1957 by Archbishop Giovanni Battista Montini (the future Pope Paul VI). He served in the Archdiocese of Milan as a pastor and faculty member of the Minor Seminary of Masnago and of Seveso San Pietro from 1960 until 1966. As well as a faculty member of the Seminary of Venegono from 1966 to 1986.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn 1 July 1989 when Pope John Paul II named Tettamanzi archbishop of Ancona-Osimo, he received his episcopal consecration from Jesuit Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini at the cathedral on the following 23 September. Upon being chosen Secretary-General and Vice President of the Italian Episcopal Conference, Tettamanzi submitted his resignation as bishop on 6 April 1991.\nJohn Paul II called Tettamanzi back into active ministry by appointing him to the Archdiocese of Genoa. He was appointed its archbishop on 20 April 1995, and in the consistory of 21 February 1998, Tettamanzi was created Cardinal-Priest of Ss. Ambrogio e Carlo. Upon the announced retirement of Cardinal Martini, Tettamanzi was reassigned as archbishop of Milan on 11 July 2002.\nWith the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II came intense speculation as to his successor. Tettamanzi's position as head of an archdiocese that was historically seen as a step towards the papacy (and considered one of the wealthiest and most powerful of Italian dioceses), as well as his charisma and popularity among the people, placed him in the view of the Italian press as one of the overall favorites to become John Paul II's successor. He himself seemed to count on success, arranging an elaborate photo-call on his departure from the diocese for the conclave. The press presented him as one of the leading Italian candidates, but the Italian cardinals are now a minority in the college. Moreover, Tettamanzi's less than imposing figure did not impress on an international level. There were reports that he never got more than two votes in the ballots. The choice in fact fell on far better known German Cardinal Ratzinger, who become Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Tettamanzi remains eligible to vote in any future conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on 14 March 2014.\nTettamanzi is said to speak only Italian, which would be a disadvantage in a time when national leaders, and especially popes, are sometimes required to master foreign languages. He is accordingly little known outside his own country.\nIn response to the motu proprio, Summorum Pontificum of Pope Benedict, Cardinal Tettamanzi controversially stated that the document did not apply to the northern Italian archdiocese since it uses the Ambrosian Rite rather than the Roman one[1].\nOn 20 March 2008, Tettamanzi issued the New Ambrosian Rite Lectionary, previously confirmed by the Holy See, that supersedes the 1976 experimental edition.\nIn March 2009, following canon 401 of Canon Law,[2] he offered to resign from his post as archbishop of Milan; Pope Benedict XVI did not accept the resignation at that time and it was believed that Tettamanzi would not leave his post in the next two years.[3] Pope Benedict accepted Cardinal Tettamanzi's resignation on the 54th anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood and appointed Angelo Scola, until then Cardinal Patriarch of Venice, as his successor. After his resignation from the post of archbishop Tettamanzi lives in Triuggio, his 101 years old mother died in early February 2012.[4][5] In July 2012 he was named apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Vigevano\n[edit] Social teaching\nCardinal Tettamanzi has declared that the goal of a company is not only to create a profit for the shareholders but that the company has to be a community of women and men that work together to satisfy the needs of the people involved in the company. He also affirmed that a person needs to have stability in his work in order to be able to plan his life. In his speech to the Diocese, in the day of St. Ambrose 2008, he said that Muslims have the right to build their mosque in cities of mainly Catholic countries.[6] In his speech to the city on St Ambrose of 2010 he reaffirmed that not all the immigrants in Italy are criminals.[7]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Vatican to clarify motu proprio soon\".

The last Archbishop of Dublin to have been a cardinal was Cardinal Edward MacCabe, who was appointed in 1882.\n[edit] Tenure tarnished by clerical sex abuse\nMain article: Sexual abuse scandal in Dublin archdiocese\nIt was Connell's failure, when Archbishop of Dublin in 1988-2004, to address adequately[2] the abuse scandals in Dublin that led the Vatican to assign Archbishop Martin as his replacement in the country's largest diocese.[3] The Murphy Report found that Connell had handled the affair \"badly\" as he was \"slow to recognise the seriousness of the situation.[4] It did praise him for making the archdiocesan records available to the authorities in 2002 and for his 1995 actions in giving the authorities the names of 17 priests who had been accused of abuse, although it said the list was incomplete as complaints were made against at least 28 priests in the Archdiocese.[5] He was criticised[6] for being economical with the truth in his use[7] of the concept of mental reservation to inadequately answer questions truthfully[8] about his knowledge of the abusive activities of priests under his control.\nFrom 1988 Connell had also continued to insure his archdiocese against liability from complainants, while claiming to the Murphy Commission that the archdiocese was \"on a learning curve\" in regard to child abuse.[9] He arranged for compensation payments to be made from a \"Stewardship Trust\" that was kept secret from the archdiocese's parishioners until 2003.[10]\nIn 1996 Connell refused to help a victim of Paul McGennis and did not pass on what he knew about McGennis to her, or to the police. He apologised for this in 2002.\nIn 2005 the prospect of Connell giving evidence to the Murphy Commission was notable in itself, according to the National Catholic Reporter: \"The 79-year-old cardinal will be rigorously questioned on his handling of complaints when he was archbishop of Dublin from 1998 until his retirement last year. Never before has an Irish prince of the Roman Catholic church found himself hauled before a state inquiry into the management of the country's largest diocese.\"[11]\n[edit] Retirement as Archbishop\nOn 26 April 2004, Desmond Connell retired as archbishop, handing the diocese over to the co-adjutor Diarmuid Martin. All bishops submit their resignation to the Pope on their 75th birthday. Connell's was accepted shortly after he turned 78. Cardinal Connell attended the 50th International Eucharistic Congress in Dublin in June 2012 and concelebrated at the Statio Orbis mass in Croke Park Stadium.\n[edit] Connell and Benedict XVI\nConnell was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. Desmond Connell is considered quite close to Pope Benedict, both theologically and personally, both having served together on a number of congregations.[citation needed]\nConnell had been a supporter of the Holy Office's declaration Dominus Iesus in 2000, applauding its opposition to relativism.[12]\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nKevin McNamara\nArchbishop of Dublin\n6 March 1988\u201326 April 2004\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nDiarmuid Martin\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nBasil Hume\nCardinal Priest of S.

On the other hand, you may be put in a position where you have to answer, and there may be circumstances in which you can use an ambiguous expression realising that the person who you are talking to will accept an untrue version of whatever it may be - permitting that to happen, not willing that it happened, that would be lying. It really is a matter of trying to deal with extraordinarily difficult matters that may arise in social relations where people may ask questions that you simply cannot answer. Everybody knows that this kind of thing is liable to happen. So, mental reservation is, in a sense, a way of answering without lying.\n^ Murphy Report, section 1.21\n^ Murphy Report, section 8.9\n^ National Catholic Reporter, 18 Nov 2005\n^ Dominus Iesus: An Ecclesiological Critique\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nGrant of arms of His Eminence Desmond Connell, Archbishop of Dublin\nDesmond Cardinal Connell (Catholic-Hierarchy)\nReport by Commission of Investigation into Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin\nCollege of Cardinals.

(Caldas da Rainha, Alvorninha, Lugar do Pego, 18 April 1902 \u2013 Lisbon, Odivelas, 20 October 1987) and wife (m. Caldas da Rainha, Alvorninha, 26 January 1935) Maria Gertrudes Rosa (Alcoba\u00e7a, Benedita, 17 October 1909 \u2013 Caldas da Rainha, Alvorninha, 6 September 1994), and ordained a priest on 15 August 1961 in Lisbon by Manuel Cardinal Cerejeira. He is the oldest of nine children: Jos\u00e9 da Cruz, Maria do C\u00e9u (b. 1939), Maria Ad\u00e9lia (b. 1942), An\u00edbal, Joaquim, Ant\u00f3nio, Maria da Gra\u00e7a, Maria Edite (b. 1947) and Fernando (b. 1952).\n[edit] Early career\nPolicarpo was director of the seminary in Penafirme, rector of the seminary in Olivais and dean of the Theological Faculty of the Portuguese Catholic University. He later served two terms as rector of the same university (1988\u201396) and is the author of a number of books and scholarly articles.\n[edit] Appointed bishop\nOn 26 May 1978 Policarpo was appointed titular bishop of Caliabria and auxiliary bishop of Lisbon, receiving episcopal ordination on 29 June. On 5 March 1997 he was appointed Coadjuctor Archbishop of Lisbon and succeeded Cardinal Ant\u00f3nio Ribeiro as Patriarch on 24 March 1998. Cardinal Policarpo is also Grand Chancellor of the Portuguese Catholic University and he was President of the Portuguese Episcopal Conference.\n[edit] Cardinalate\nHe was created and proclaimed Cardinal by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001, as Cardinal-Priest of Sant'Antonio in Campo Marzio (St. Anthony in the Field of Mars). Cardinal da Cruz Policarpo is a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education, Pontifical Council for the Laity, and Pontifical Council for Culture in the Roman Curia.\nUpon the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Policarpo was considered to be papabile \u2013 a possible successor to the papacy. On 11 April 2005, British newspaper The Guardian considered him to be \"a dark-horse candidate for pope, capable of bridging the divide between the Europeans and the Latin American Roman Catholic cardinals\". The 2005 papal conclave, in which he participated as a cardinal elector, ultimately elected Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Controversies\n[edit] Pro-choice politicians\nHis refusal to excommunicate those who called themselves Catholics and who openly supported legalization of abortion was also criticized by many pro-life Catholics for being one the main reasons of the legalization of abortion in Portugal, in 2007. However, he did not openly deny the right to the Portuguese Roman Catholic priests to refuse them communion, which many in fact did.[1] Portuguese President An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva who chose not to veto the law that legalized abortion in Portugal is a Roman Catholic, but he was never openly criticized by Jos\u00e9 Policarpo for his attitude.\n[edit] Marriages with Muslim men\nOn 14 January 2009, the cardinal directed a warning to young women to \"think twice\" before marrying Muslim men: Christians should learn more about Islam and respect Muslims, but marrying a Muslim man is getting into a lot of trouble, that not even Allah knows where it would end, if the couple moved to an Islamic country.[2][3][4] He also said that dialogue \"with our Muslim brothers\" is difficult, because it is possible to dialogue only with those who want to have dialogue.[2] Human rights group Amnesty International criticized Policarpo for inciting \"discrimination\" and \"intolerance\", and a representative of the Muslim community in Portugal said they were hurt and surprised by his words, but remarked that his words could be interpreted as a call to respect differences and get to know the other religion.[5] A spokesman for the Portuguese Episcopal Conference said the cardinal had offered \"realistic advice\" rather than \"discrimination\" or \"contempt for another culture or religion\".[3]\n[edit] Ordination of women\nCardinal da Cruz Policarpo in June 2011 stated in a magazine interview that, while there is no fundamental theological obstacle to ordination of women, there is, in fact, an obstacle regarding the strong tradition dating from Jesus. There will certainly be no change in our lifetime, he said, and so the question ought not to be raised \u2013 it provokes many reactions.[6][7] Nearly two weeks after giving the interview, he issued a clarification of his comments, in which he unequivocally reaffirmed the teaching of Pope John Paul II in Ordinatio Sacerdotalis.[8]\n[edit] See also\n\nCollege of Cardinals\nList of Cardinals from Portugal\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ [1]\n^ a b Portugal cardinal warns of marriage with Muslims (Reuters, 14 January 2009)\n^ a b (Der Spiegel, 15 January 2009)\n^ Portuguese Church: 'Think twice about marrying Muslims' (Daily Mail, 15 January 2009)\n^ Controversy over Christian-Muslim marriages in Portugal (Trend, Azerbaijan, 15 January 2009)\n^ \"N\u00e3o foi por acaso que Jesus escolheu para ap\u00f3stolos homens e deu \u00e0s mulheres outro tipo de aten\u00e7\u00e3o [...] teol\u00f3gicamente n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nenhum obst\u00e1culo fundamental [...] O problema p\u00f5e-se noutra \u00f3tica, numa forte tradi\u00e7\u00e3o, que vem desde Jesus [...] N\u00e3o \u00e9 com certeza para a nossa vida, hoje ent\u00e3o, no momento que estamos a viver, \u00e9 um daqueles problemas que \u00e9 melhor n\u00e3o levantar...suscita uma s\u00e9rie de rea\u00e7\u00f5es\" (Text of the interview, in Portuguese).\n^ The Patriarch of Lisbon: \"There are no theological reasons for excluding women from the priesthood\" (La Stampa, 25 June 2011)\n^ Statement from the Patriarchate of Lisbon\n\n\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAnt\u00f3nio Ribeiro\nPatriarch of Lisbon\n1998\u2013present\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 51432678\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nPolicarpo, Jose Da Cruz\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n26 February 1936\n\n\nPlace of birth\nAlvorninha, Portugal\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6499/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 35357/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 28426/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 9280/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1687656-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130228045125 ", "Name": "Jos\u00e9 da Cruz Policarpo"}, {"url": "/wiki/Godfried_Danneels", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Godfried Danneels\n\n\nCardinal-Archbishop Emeritus of Mechelen-Brussels\n\n\n\n\n\nArchdiocese\nMechelen-Brussels\n\n\nProvince\nMechelen-Brussels\n\n\nSee\n\n\n\nSt. Rumbold's Cathedral, St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral, Santa Anastasia al Palatino\n\n\n\n\n\nAppointed\n19 December 1979\n\n\nReign ended\n18 January 2010\n\n\nPredecessor\nLeo Jozef Suenens\n\n\nSuccessor\nAndr\u00e9-Joseph L\u00e9onard\n\n\nOther posts\n\n\n\nCardinal-Priest of Sant'Anastasia al Palatino\n\n\n\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nOrdination\n17 August 1957\nby\u00a0Emiel-Jozef De Smedt\n\n\nConsecration\n18 December 1977\nby\u00a0Leo Jozef Suenens\n\n\nCreated Cardinal\n2 February 1983\n\n\nRank\nCardinal-Priest\n\n\nPersonal details\n\n\nBirth name\nGodfried Maria Jules Danneels\n\n\nBorn\n(1933-06-04) 4 June 1933 (age\u00a079)\nKanegem, Tielt\n\n\nNationality\nBelgian\n\n\nDenomination\nRoman Catholic\n\n\nOccupation\nTheologian\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\n\nBishop of Antwerp (1977 - 1979)\nBishop of the Military Ordinariate of Belgium (1980 - 2010)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlma mater\nCatholic University of Leuven\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Danneels in full choir dress (left)\n\n\n\n\nStyles of\nGodfried Danneels\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nMechelen-Brussels\n\n\nGodfried Maria Jules Danneels (born 4 June 1933) is a Belgian cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.

Danneels entered the Grand Seminary of Bruges to become a priest. He was ordained on 17 August 1957 by Emiel-Jozef De Smedt, Bishop of Brugge.[1]\n[edit] Professor and pastor\nHe studied Thomistic philosophy at the Higher Institute of Philosophy in Leuven and theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. After obtaining his doctorate in theology, he taught at the Bruges seminary and at the Catholic University of Leuven.\nAs a scholar, he carried out a profound study of the liturgy. The articles he wrote for the Dictionary of the Liturgy have made him famous throughout the Catholic world. Danneels was actively involved in writing Sacrosanctum Concilium[citation needed], a document which initiated the liturgical reform of the Second Vatican Council.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn 4 November 1977, Danneels was named Bishop of Antwerp by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 18 from Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens. Danneels was promoted to the Archbishopric of Mechelen-Brussel on 19 December 1979 and thus the Primate of Belgium and the Bishop of the nation's Catholic military ordinariate.\n[edit] Cardinal\nDaneels was created a Cardinal-Priest of Santa Anastasia by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 2 February 1983.\nSince 2001, Danneels has been a part of the permanent secretariat of the episcopal synod. He is also a member of the Curial Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and of the Congregation for the Clergy. Between 1990 and 1999, he was international chairman for Pax Christi, a Catholic peace organisation. Danneels was awarded honorary doctorates by Georgetown University and the Catholic University of Tilburg. In 1996, he underwent a major heart operation.\nIn 2003, Danneel's was voted the \"most remarkable personality of the year\" by Flemish television viewers. His mother tongue in this bilingual (or trilingual) country is Dutch. But he also speaks English, French, German and Italian fluently. In 2005 he also led the funeral service of Grand Duchess Josephine Charlotte of Luxembourg.\nRegarding euthanasia, Danneels said on 13 April 2008:\n\n\"... it is a choice between two civilizations, a civilization of people who want to take control of themselves and a civilization with a god and place for superhuman elements ... it is an excrescence of a typical evolution, of a cancerous growth of consciousness that luckily woke up during Renaissance but that has taken cancerous proportions now, that broke away.\"[citation needed]\n\nHe conducted the 2008 wedding of Count Rodolphe de Limburg Stirum to Archduchess Marie-Christine of Austria, daughter of Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg.\n[edit] Concealment of child sex abuse\nPerhaps Daneels' most difficult moment came in 1998, when a court found that the Belgian Catholic Church had failed to protect the victims of a paedophile priest. Danneels voluntarily testified in court, but denied that he had known anything about the abuse. It was the first time ever that a cardinal had appeared before a secular court in Belgium.\nOn 8 April 2010, Danneels, already retired, recommended temporary silence about a sex abuse case that had involved Bishop Roger Vangheluwe in the late 1970s to 1980s.The abuse began when Vangheluwe was a priest and continued after he was made a bishop. Daneels advised the victim, a nephew of Vangheluwe, to delay a public statement until Vangheluwe had retired.[2] At another meeting Vangheluwe, in Danneels' presence, made a private apology, which the victim rejected and went public with his charges. On 23 April 2010, Bishop Vangheluwe resigned, admitting his guilt publicly. Four months later, Vangheluwe's nephew supplied tape recordings of the two meetings to two Belgian newspapers, which published them on 28 August 2010.[3] One of the two newspapers, De Standaard, described Danneels' action as \"containment, nothing more\", saying that Danneels' \"only aim is to avoid having the case made public so many years after the facts\".[3] The Belgian police then questioned Danneels with regard to the case, concerning which a priest had tried to alert him in about 1996 but had not been heeded.[3]\nSpeaking through a spokesman, Toon Osaer, Danneels explained that he had been unprepared for the meeting and that his proposal that the victim remain silent was \"an improvisation\".[4]\n[edit] Papal conclave of 2005\nUpon the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Danneels was listed as a possible successor (or papabile) although with weakened credentials due to the fact that he was an archbishop of a country where abortion, euthanasia and same-sex unions had recently been legalized and where, under his watch, church attendance and pastoral vocations have dropped to historical lows.[5][6][7]\nDanneels participated in the 2005 papal conclave, which elected Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Retirement and succession\nIn 2008, Danneels reached the mandatory age of retirement and, on 18 January 2010, he was replaced as Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels by Andr\u00e9-Mutien L\u00e9onard, \"known as one of the most 'conservative' of the prelates of the Belgian Catholic Church\".[8]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Holy See Press Office. \"Danneels Card.

He studied at the seminaries of Esztergom and Budapest, and the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome (where he attained a doctorate in both theology and canon law). On 18 June 1975, Erd\u0151 was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop L\u00e1szl\u00f3 L\u00e9kai, and was incardinated in the Archdiocese of Esztergom.[1] He worked as vicar in Dorog, and then continued his studies in Rome from 1977 to 1980. For the next eight years, he taught as a professor of theology and canon law at the Seminary of Esztergom, and held guest lectures at several foreign universities. Erd\u0151 served in the Hungarian Episcopal Conference as Secretary of the Commission of Canon Law in 1986, and later as its President in 1999. In 1988 he began teaching theology at the P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter Catholic University, serving as rector from 1998 to 2003.

Erd\u0151 was named Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest on 7 December 2002, and as such, he received the title of Primate of Hungary.[1] Cardinal Erd\u0151 became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2007.[2] In 2011 he was appointed as \"doctor honoris causa\" by the University of Navarra (Spain).\n[edit] Cardinal\nHe was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Balbina by John Paul II in the consistory of 21 October 2003. He was the youngest cardinal member of the Sacred College until the creation of Reinhard Marx in 2010.\nErd\u0151 was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI, and can continue to exercise his right to vote in any future conclave until his 80th birthday on 25 June 2032.[3]\nThe Cardinal was elected President of the Hungarian Episcopal Conference in September 2005 for a five-year term, and President of the Council of Episcopal Conferences of Europe in October 2006 for the same period of time.

As Bishop of Gniezno he became also the Primate of Poland.[2] (The title of Primate of Poland was conferred on the Archbishop of Gniezno by Pope Martin V in 1418 and confirmed by Leo X in 1515, every Primate of Poland to the time of his election, even if he is not a cardinal, has the right to wear the red \"zucchetto\" of a cardinal, a privilege already accorded in 1600 and confirmed by Benedict XIV in 1749.)\n[edit] Cardinal\nGlemp was created and proclaimed Cardinal-Priest by John Paul II in the Consistory of 2 February 1983.[2] Titular Church of St. Mary in Trastevere. On 25 March 1992, with the restructuring of the Church dioceses in Poland, John Paul II dissolved the union \"ad personam\" of Gniezno-Warsaw, naming as Metropolitan Archbishop of Gniezno Bishop Henryk Muszynski. The Holy Father decided that the title of Primate of Poland should remain linked to the historical heritage of S. Adalberto in the Archdiocese of Gniezno and confirmed that Cardinal J\u00f3zef Glemp, Archbishop of Warsaw, who had custody of the relics of S. Adalberto, which were venerated in the Cathedral of Gniezno, should continue to bear the title of Primate of Poland. Later, Pope Benedict XVI stipulated that Cardinal Glemp, despite his retirement, would remain primate until 18 December 2009, his 80th birthday.[3]\n[edit] Episcopal conference\nCardinal Glemp acted as President of the Episcopal Conference of Poland for 23 years, from 1981 until March 2004.[3]\nHe was president delegate to the 1st Special Assembly for Europe of the Synod of Bishops (1991).\nGlemp was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Apostolic administrator\nOn 7 January 2007, it was announced that Cardinal Glemp would be acting as the Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese of Warsaw due to the resignation of Stanis\u0142aw Wielgus.[4] On 3 March 2007, Kazimierz Nycz was appointed to the Warsaw see.\n[edit] Death\n\n\n\n\nTomb of J\u00f3zef Glemp in St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw\n\n\nGlemp died from lung cancer on 23 January 2013 in Warsaw at the age of 83.[5] Funeral celebrations lasted three days, from 26 to 28 January 2013, and took place in three major churches of Warsaw.

Over a hundred prelates from Poland and abroad (among them, Prague's Cardinal Dominik Duka, Budapest's Cardinal Peter Erdo, Barcelona's Cardinal Lluis Martinez Sistach, Cologne's Cardinal Joachim Meisner, and Zagreb's Cardinal Josip Bozani\u0107) concelebrated, with Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, the Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, presiding. The homily was given by the Archbishop of Gniezno, J\u00f3zef Kowalczyk, the incumbent Primate of Poland. Afterwards, the late primate was entombed in a crypt of the Cathedral.[6][7][8]\nAt his Funeral Mass, Cardinal Nycz, who expressed his own gratitude to his deceased predecessor, read a testament from the will of the late Cardinal Primate, of which the following are parts,:\n\"I give my thanks to God for the grace of faith and the consequences flowing from it.\" ... \"Despite the weakness and sinfulness, I had no breaks in the faith.\" ... \"I am impressed by the zeal of many priests, whose dedication to Christ through Mary is quiet and without fanfare.\" ... (Regarding Czestochowa): \"... Poland learned to love and understand the history of the gracious providence of God.\" ... \"I am strongly sorry for all the Brothers and Sisters in Christ, for the distress caused by the lack of proper love. I could not always appreciate the efforts and dedication of many.\"\nAt the beginning of the Funeral Mass, the principal celebrant, Cardinal Dziwisz, said that,:\n\"Today the Church in Poland and all of our homeland pays tribute to the late Cardinal Joseph Glemp. In the difficult times of Communism, he became boldly and wisely on the side of the people, striving for freedom and complete independence from the totalitarian system. The Primate showed great composure and wisdom of life in the face of extreme political divisions, relieving internal tensions with great prudence, and in tough times of transformation he remained faithful to God and to the Church.\" Cardinal Dziwisz noted that Cardinal Glemp continued the tradition of the Cardinal Primate of the Millennium, Cardinal Wyszynski, strengthening the faith and spirit of the nation, supported by Blessed Pope John Paul II.[9]\nPolish President Bronislaw Komorowski praised the Cardinal for his later role in \"building a free and democratic Poland\" and said his own family had benefited from the cardinal's aid committee for imprisoned opposition members. \"He was a good son of the homeland and profound patriot, able to act in the name not only of patriotic emotions, but also of a rational view of each situation, quietly evaluating the interests of state and nation,\" Komorowski said in a funeral oration.\nArchbishop Kowalczyk noted the Primate had headed the Polish Church in \"hard and uncertain\" times. \"His life was not easy and his service (was) demanding.\"[10]\n[edit] Curial membership\n\nOriental Churches (congregation)[1]\nCulture (council)[1]\nApostolic Signatura (tribunal)[1]\n\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Radio Maryja\nPrimate Jozef Glemp said in 2005 that the Catholic Radio Maryja was causing a rift in the Church.[11]\n[edit] Wielgus affair\nDuring the controversy surrounding the alleged collaboration of bishop Stanislaw Wielgus with the communist secret services, Cardinal Glemp said that the prelate was a true servant of God and that media accusations against him were unfounded or exaggerated.[12]\n[edit] Statements on Jews\nGlemp's statements caused some controversy within the Jewish community,[13] including from Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who repeats statements Glemp is said to have made, including that Jews were \"plying [Polish] peasants with alcohol\" and \"spreading communism\" and that they \"control the mass-media in many countries.\" [14] Professor Joanna B. Michlic makes reference to Glemp, among others, \"utter[ing] many overt and covert references to Jews as the harmful other in Poland.\" [15]\nGlemp \"said he recognized that his widely publicized homily might have caused pain among Jews, and he expressed regret.\" [13]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c d e Brunson, Matthew (15 October 2008). 2009 Catholic Almanac.

He is also a Cardinal of the Catholic Church. After the transfer of the see of Lviv to Kiev in 2005, he was the Ukrainian Catholic Major Archbishop of Kiev-Galicia. In February 2011 he became Major Archeparch Emeritus after he resigned due to ill health.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early life and ordination\n1.2 Pastoral work\n1.3 Bishop\n1.4 Major Archbishop and Cardinal\n\n\n2 Sources and references\n3 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Biography\n[edit] Early life and ordination\nBorn in Lviv, Husar fled[citation needed] with his parents in 1944 during World War II. They briefly lived in Salzburg, Austria, then emigrated to the United States in 1949.[1]\nFrom 1950 to 1954 he studied at St. Basil College Seminary in Stamford, Connecticut. He studied at The Catholic University of America and Fordham University in the United States, and was ordained a priest on 30 March 1958 for the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Stamford.\n[edit] Pastoral work\nFrom 1958 to 1969, he taught at St. Basil College Seminary and was pastor at Holy Trinity Ukrainian Catholic Church in Kerhonkson, New York between 1966 and 1969. In 1969, Husar went to Rome, where he spent three years earning a doctorate in theology at the Pontifical Urbaniana University. He then entered the Monastery of the Studites in Grottaferrata in Italy, and was named its Superior in 1974.\n[edit] Bishop\nHe was consecrated a bishop in 1977 in the Castel Gandolfo chapel by Major Archbishop Josyf Slipyj without the papal permission (apostolic mandate) in an act which caused many irritations in the Roman Curia,[2] as Roman canon law required papal permission for the consecration of a bishop, but at that time Eastern canon law did not. He was named Archimandrite (Archabbot) of the Studite Monks in Europe and America in 1978. He organized a new Studite monastery in Ternopil, Ukraine, in 1994, and was elected by the Synod of Bishops of the Ukrainian Church as exarch of the archiepiscopal exarchy of Kiev and Vyshhorod in 1995, confirmed by the Pope the following year. Although once a citizen of the United States, Husar gave up his American citizenship upon returning to his native Ukraine.\n[edit] Major Archbishop and Cardinal\n\n\nStyles of\nLubomyr Husar\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nKiev and Halych\n\n\nIn December 2000, Pope John Paul II named Husar apostolic administrator of the Ukrainian Greek Major-Archeparchy of Lviv, and in January 2001 the Ukrainian Greek synod elected him Major Archbishop. On 21 February of that year Pope John Paul II created and proclaimed Husar Cardinal-Priest of Santa Sofia a Via Boccea. Cardinal Husar was only one of two Eastern Catholics to participate in the papal conclave, 2005, the other being Ignace Daoud. (Nasrallah Sfeir and Stephanos II Ghattas were both over 80 and therefore could not take part.) At that papal conclave, he was one of the cardinals considered papabile, something unusual for an Eastern Catholic.\nThe major archiepiscopal see of Lviv was moved on 21 August 2005, to the city of Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. He is acclaimed by his followers as Patriarch of Kiev-Galicia, a title not recognized by the Holy See.\nIn October 2007, Husar received an honorary doctorate from the Catholic University of America in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the first assigning of a bishop of the UGCC to the United States.[3]\nIn February 2008, a celebratory liturgy was held in the Basilica of Santa Sophia in Rome on the occasion of the 75th birthday and 50th anniversary of priesthood of Cardinal Husar. The Head of the UGCC was greeted by Pope Benedict XVI, whose address was read by the secretary of Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, Monsignor Maurizio Malvestiti.[4]\nIn 2008 Viktor Yushchenko signed a decree to decorate Cardinal Husar with the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise (the 3rd class). He was honoured with the highest state award \u201cfor his outstanding personal contribution in spiritual revival of the Ukrainian nation, longstanding church work, and to mark his 75th birthday\u201d.\nWith failing eyesight forcing him to perform the church's intricate liturgical rites from memory, his early resignation was accepted on 10 February 2011[5] although normally the major archbishop serves for life. Cardinal Husar's resignation triggered a meeting of the Synod of the Ukrainian church, comprising its global body of bishops, to elect a new major archbishop, which must begin within a month. In the interim, Ihor Vozniak, C.SS.R., Archeparch of Lviv, served as administrator. The last major archbishop to leave office was in 1882. Once a new major archbishop is elected by the synod the election requires confirmation by the Pope, whereas that of a new patriarch needs to be notified to the Pope, who will then extend ecclesiastical communion to the new patriarch. However, a major archbishop has de facto patriarchal status. A new major archbishop was selected 23 March and confirmed by the pope 25 March 2011.\nOn 26 February 2013, 2 days before the announced resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Husar turned 80 and lost the right to participate in a conclave.\n[edit] Sources and references\n\n\n^ \"A Church that was supposed to disappear\".

He served as a priest for two years (1950\u20131952) before returning to school, obtaining three doctorates by 1965 \u2013 one in theology from the Jagiellonian University, and Ph.D.s from the Lublin Catholic University and Warsaw Theological Academy.\nIn 1970, he was made secretary of the Polish Bishops' Scientific Council from 1970 to 1984. He was Dean of the Pontifical Theological Faculty in Krak\u00f3w from 1976 to 1981, and its Rector from 1981\u20131987.\nAppointed apostolic administrator of Lviv for territories within Poland in May 1984, he was consecrated bishop on June 23. He was made archbishop on January 16, 1991.\nWith the consistory of February 21, 1998, Jaworski was created Cardinal by John Paul II in pectore, one of four such secret cardinal appointments made by the pontiff during his tenure; Jaworski's cardinalate was publicly proclaimed at the consistory of February 21, 2001. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.

He was ordained by Cardinal Julius D\u00f6pfner in Rome on 10 October 1963.[1] From 1964 to 1967 he was a research assistant to Karl Rahner at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich; in 1967 he earned his second doctorate from the Pontifical Gregorian University, in theology.[1] Lehmann became a professor at the Johannes-Gutenberg Universit\u00e4t in 1968; from 1971 until 1983 he taught Ecumenical and Dogmatic Theology at the Albert Ludwigs Universit\u00e4t.[1]\n\n\nStyles of\nKarl Lehmann\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nMainz\n\n\n[edit] Ecclesiastical career\nLehmann was appointed Bishop of Mainz by Pope John Paul II on 23 June 1983 and consecrated on 2 October of the same year by his predecessor Cardinal Hermann Volk in Mainz Cathedral.[1]\nIn September 1987 the Bishop became chairman of the Conference of the German Bishops.[1] He was subsequently reelected in 1993, 1999 and 2005. On 28 January 2001, Pope John Paul II appointed him Cardinal-Priest of the titular church of S. Leone I.[2] He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.[1] Lehmann remains eligible to vote in any future conclaves that start before his 80th birthday on 16 May 2016.\n[edit] Awards and honors\nCardinal Lehmann was appointed a Commander of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by Jacques Chirac in 2006.[3] He has received numerous honorary degrees from institutions such as the University of Innsbruck (1991), The Catholic University of America (1994), the Pontifical University of Maynooth (1997), the Catholic Theological Academy of Warsaw (2000), the Karl-Franzens-Universit\u00e4t Graz (2002), the University of Opole (2004), and the University of Ia\u015fi (2000).[3] Also in 2000, Bishop Lehmann was awarded the Gro\u00dfes Verdienstkreuz mit Stern und Schulterband, as well as honorary citizenship in the City of Mainz in 2001.[3] Since 2008 he is member of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.\n[edit] Resignation from the Conference of German Bishops\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Lehmann's mitre, design by Josef Plum (1984).\n\n\nOn 18 February 2008, Cardinal Lehmann prematurely stepped down from his post as chairman of the Congregation of German Bishops, citing recent health problems.[4] Lehmann set a record for the longest term as chairman of the conference, his more than 7,400 day-long term surpassing the length of the terms of all his predecessors, including Josef Frings.[5]\nIn 2009, he criticized Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos after the controversy on the lifting of the excommunication of bishop Richard Williamson.[6]\n[edit] Coat of arms\n\nCardinal Lehmann's episcopal coat of arms incorporates various elements, such as the wheel from the arms of the Diocese of Mainz, the key from the Diocese of Worms, and an open book with the letters Alpha and Omega, a symbol of the message of Jesus Christ (as well as for the cardinal's personal enthusiasm for books).[3]\nHis Latin motto, State in fide, \"Stand firmly in the faith\", is derived from 1\u00a0Corinthians 16:13.\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h Giebelmann, Dietmar (2006-09-05). \"Tabellarischer Lebenslauf von Kardinal Lehmann\".

He was Archbishop of Paris from 1981 until his resignation in 2005.

Aaron Lustiger studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Montaigne in Paris, where he first encountered anti-Semitism.[3][4] Visiting Germany in 1937, he was hosted by an anti-Nazi Protestant family whose children had been required to join the Hitler Youth.[2][5]\nSometime between the ages of ten and twelve, Lustiger came across a Protestant Bible and felt inexplicably attracted to it. On the outbreak of war in September 1939 the family located to Orl\u00e9ans.[2][5]\nIn March 1940, during Holy Week, the 13-year old Lustiger decided to convert to Roman Catholicism. On 21 August he was baptized as Aaron Jean-Marie by the Bishop of Orl\u00e9ans, Jules Marie Courcoux. His sister converted later.[6] In October 1940, the Vichy regime passed the first Statute on Jews, which forced Jews to wear a yellow badge. Although Jean-Marie Lustiger lived hidden in Orl\u00e9ans, his parents had to wear the badge [3]\nLustiger, his father and sister sought refuge in unoccupied southern France, while his mother returned to Paris to run the family business. In September 1942, his mother was deported to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp where she died the following year. The surviving family returned to Paris after the war.[6] Lustiger's father tried unsuccessfully to have his son's baptism annulled, and even sought the help of the chief rabbi of Paris.

He then entered the seminary of the Carmelite fathers in Paris, and later the Institut Catholique de Paris. After his first visit to Israel in 1951, he was ordained to the priesthood on 17 April 1954 by Bishop \u00c9mile-Ars\u00e8ne Blanchet, rector of the Institut Catholique de Paris.[2] From 1954 to 1959, he was a chaplain at the Sorbonne, and for the next ten years, the director of Richelieu Centre, which trains university chaplains and counsels lay teachers and students from grandes \u00e9coles such as the \u00c9NS-Fontenay-Saint-Cloud or the Ecole des Chartes. From 1969 to 1979, he was vicar of Sainte-Jeanne-de-Chantal, in the wealthy XVIe arrondissement of Paris, with his parochial vicar Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois, who would later become his successor as Archbishop of Paris.\nOn 10 November 1979, Lustiger was appointed by Pope John Paul II Bishop of Orl\u00e9ans after a 15-month vacancy.[2] John Paul II had been advised by Cardinal Paolo Bertoli, who was displeased with a new illustrated Catechism for French urban youth (Pierres vivantes) and was on bad terms with most of the French clergy.[8]\nLustiger received episcopal consecration on the 8 December 1979 from Cardinal Fran\u00e7ois Marty, with Archbishop Eug\u00e8ne Ernoult of Sens and Bishop Daniel P\u00e9zeril serving as co-consecrators. When installed as bishop, Lustiger avoided all reference to his liberal predecessor Guy-Marie Riob\u00e9, a pacifist close to Catholic Action.[2]\n[edit] Archbishop of Paris (1981-2005)\n\n\n\n\nJean Marie Lustiger, 1988\n\n\nHe was promoted on 31 January 1981, to Archbishop of Paris, succeeding Cardinal Marty. According to Georges Suffert, he was supported by a letter to John Paul II written by Andr\u00e9 Frossard.[2] The founder of the Traditionalist Catholic group Society of St. Pius X Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre criticized his nomination, complaining that the function was given to \"someone who is not truly of French origin.[6]\" On the other hand, Lustiger's nomination was soon seen as a defeat by liberal French clergy.[8]\nA first-rate communicator and a personal friend of Jean G\u00e9lamur, head of the Catholic media group Bayard Presse,[8] Lustiger was particularly attentive to the media and developed Catholic radio and television channels (Radio Notre-Dame) after Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's liberalization of French media in 1981. He founded KTO TV in 1999, which became a financial disaster.[1] Lustiger also founded a new seminary for training priests, by-passing the existing arrangements.\nConsidered quite authoritarian, which earned him the nickname \"Bulldozer\",[1][6] Lustiger deposed the general vicars Michel Guittet and Pierre Gervaise, had Georges Gilson transferred to Le Mans and Emile Marcus to Nantes, personally headed the meetings of the episcopal council and made numerous other changes.[8] He dismantled P. B\u00e9guerie's team in Saint-S\u00e9verin.[8] In October 1981, the French bishops elected the more liberal Jean Vilnet as President of the Episcopal Conference, with whom Lustiger was on difficult terms throughout his life.[8] In 1982, he invited for the celebration of Lent in Notre-Dame Roger Etchegaray (whom he disliked at first) and the Jesuit Roger Heckel.[8] He participated in the annual meeting of the movement Comunione e Liberazione in Rimini in summer 1982.[8] In January 1983 he invited Cardinal Ratzinger to Notre-Dame, where the latter criticized new catechisms proposed by a large part of the French clergy.[8]\nHe was created Cardinal-Priest of Santi Marcellino e Pietro by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 2 February 1983, at the same time as the Jesuit theologian Henri de Lubac;[8] one year later, on 26 November, he was named Cardinal-Priest of San Luigi dei Francesi. Now a cardinal, Lustiger began to attract international attention. The obscure Prophecy of Malachy, which spoke of a Jewish Pope, strengthened a rumour about him being papabile.[8]\nLustiger carried out several reforms in the Archdiocese of Paris concerning priests' formation, creating in 1984 an independent theological faculty in the \u00c9cole cath\u00e9drale de Paris, distinct from the Institut Catholique. He constructed seven new churches in Paris and supported the development of charismatic movements such as the Emmanuel Community (of which he was in charge until June 2006) and the Chemin Neuf Community, which was recognized in 1984 by the Vatican as an International Association of the Faithful. Some parishes were entrusted to charismatic movements. In Paris, he ordained 200 priests who represented 15 percent of the French total, drawn from a diocese which had two per cent of the French population.[5] Strongly attached to the ideal of priestly celibacy he prevented, as Ordinary for Orientals, the deployment of married Eastern Rite Catholic priests in France. He was favourable to the development of a permanent diaconate filled mainly by married men involved in the workplace.\nIn 1984, he led a mass rally at Versailles in opposition to the Savary Law, which reduced state aid to private (and mostly Catholic) education, outdoing his comrades Jean Vilnet, Paul Guiberteau and Jean Honor\u00e9, who were leaders on the issue.[8] Shortly afterwards Alain Savary had to resign. This opposition cemented Lustiger's relations with the groups supporting private education, from whose midst he was to draw most of his candidates for the priesthood. He nevertheless supported the 1905 Law on the Separation of Church and State, but, when testifying before the Commission Stasi on secularism, he opposed the 2004 law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools.[9]\nLustiger had his right-hand man, Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois, appointed bishop in 1988. Following Marcel Lefebvre's schism in June 1988, Lustiger tried to reduce tensions with the Traditionalist Catholics, celebrating a Tridentine Mass,[8] sending a conservative priest Patrick Le Gal as his emissary to Lefebvre [8] Along with Cardinal Albert Decourtray, he strongly criticised Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ in 1988, clashing with the liberal bishop Jacques Gaillot.[8]\nBeside his clerical contacts, Lustiger maintained contacts with the political world, maintaining rather good working relations with Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's Socialist government, despite their political disagreements.[8] Thus, during the celebrations of the second centenary of the French Revolution in 1989, he opposed Minister of Culture Jack Lang about the Pantheonization of the Abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire, one of the first priests to take the oath on the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. For this, he was criticized by the liberal Catholic review Golias.[10] He deposed the priest Alain Maillard de La Morandais from his diplomatic functions towards the political sphere, as he considered him to be too pro-Balladur during the 1995 presidential campaign [3] Despite his opposition to Mitterrand's governments, he presided as Archbishop of Paris over Mitterrand's funeral.\nLustiger's search for dialogue with politicians led to the establishment in 1992 of the Centre Pastoral d'Etudes politiques at St. Clotilde church in the 7th arrondissement, close to the hub of the French establishment. He sought to identify and conciliate rising national \u00e9lites in politics and communication. He was less amenable to initiatives from non-French Catholic groups or individuals (their position was inconclusively debated at the Diocesan Synod).\nRelations with the cultural sphere were promoted by a series of Lenten Sermons at Notre-Dame (into which dialogue with prominent French intellectuals and state-employed academics were introduced) and by plans for the opening of the Centre St. Bernard in the 5th arrondissement.\nLustiger was never elected as head of the Conf\u00e9rence des \u00e9v\u00eaques de France (French Episcopal Conference) by his peers, with whom he was not popular, but he was elected a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in 1995, succeeding Albert Decourtray and bypassing Cardinal Paul Poupard.[8] Two years later, he organized a World Youth Day in Paris, attended by more than a million people.[6]\n[edit] Theology and ethics\nLustiger upheld papal authority in theology and morals: \"There are opinions and there is faith,\" he said in 1997. \"When it is faith, I agree with the Pope because I am responsible for the faith.\" Cardinal Lustiger was a strong believer in priestly celibacy and opposed abortion and the ordination of women.[6] Although he fully endorsed John Paul II's views on bioethics, he considered condom use if one of the partners had HIV.[8] He founded the Non-Governmental Organization Tib\u00e9riade to attend to AIDS patients.[8]\nHe considered Christianity to be the accomplishment of Judaism, and the New Testament to be the logical continuation of the Old Testament. In Le Choix de Dieu (The Choice of God, 1987), he declared that modern anti-Semitism was the product of the Enlightenment, whose philosophy he attacked.[3][8]\nHe read the Thomistic philosophers \u00c9tienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain \u2014 one of the main Catholic thinkers of his youth \u2014 as well as Jean Guitton, but also the Protestant philosopher Paul Ric\u0153ur, and Maurice Clavel, and the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.[8] Close to Augustinism, he preferred the post-conciliar theologian Louis Bouyer to the (pre-conciliar) neo-Thomist Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange.[8] His main influence was Henri de Lubac, as well as the Jesuits Albert and Paul Chapelle.[8] Lustiger, unlike other leading twentieth-century French bishops, did not draw noticeably on patristic writings and was more sensitive to rabbinic texts.\nWhen appointed to Paris he encouraged some liberal clergy to return to the lay state. He was influential in the appointment of his moderate conciliar auxiliary Georges Gilson to the See of Le Mans, replacing senior clergy with men who shared similar views to his own.\nHe pursued ecumenism but also gave a critical address of Anglicanism when welcoming Archbishop Robert Runcie to Notre Dame.[citation needed] In 1995, Lustiger played a key role in deposing the liberal bishop of \u00c9vreux, Jacques Gaillot, who was then transferred to the titular see of Partenia.\nLustiger was an outspoken opponent of racism and anti-Semitism. He was strongly critical of Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the French National Front, comparing Le Pen's xenophobic views to Nazism. \"We have known for 50 years that the theory of racial inequality can be deadly...It entails outrages\", Lustiger said. \"The Christian faith says that all men are equal in dignity because they are all created in the image of God\". He supported the action of the parish priest of St. Bernard-de-la-Chapelle in accepting the protracted sit-in of a group of illegal aliens in 1996, but subsequently showed less sympathy to such activities. The police were called to a similar sit-in at St. Merry.\nHe incurred the hostility of some in the Spanish Church because he strongly opposed the project to canonise Queen Isabella I of Castile. In 1974, Pope Paul VI had opened her cause for beatification, which placed her on the path toward possible sainthood. Lustiger's opposition was due to the fact that Isabella and her husband Ferdinand of Aragon had expelled Jews from her domains in 1492.\nLustiger was a favorite of Pope John Paul II. He had a Polish background and staunchly upheld the Pope's conservative views in the face of much hostility from liberal Catholic opinion in France. This led to some speculation that Lustiger would be a candidate to succeed John Paul II, but he always refused to discuss any such possibility. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Relations with the Jewish world\nAlong with Cardinal Francis Arinze[11] and Bishop Jean-Baptiste Gourion of Jerusalem, Lustiger was one of only three prelates of his time who were converts to the Roman Catholic faith; he and Gourion were the only two who were born Jewish and still considered themselves 'Jewish' all their lives.[12][13] He said he was proud of his Jewish origins and described himself as a \"fulfilled Jew,\" for which he was chastised by Christians and Jews alike. Former Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi of Israel Yisrael Meir Lau publicly denounced Lustiger. Lau accused Lustiger of betraying the Jewish people by converting to Catholicism.[14] Lustiger, who claimed that he was still a Jew, considered being \"Jewish\" as an ethnic designation and not exclusively a religious one. Lustiger's strong support for the State of Israel, which conflicts with the Vatican's officially neutral position, also won him Jewish support.\nOn becoming Archbishop of Paris, Lustiger said:\n\n\"I was born Jewish and so I remain, even if that is unacceptable for many. For me, the vocation of Israel is bringing light to the goyim. That is my hope and I believe that Christianity is the means for achieving it.\"\n\nThe former chief rabbi of France, Rabbi Ren\u00e9 Samuel Sirat, says he personally witnessed Lustiger entering the synagogue to recite kaddish \u2014 the Jewish mourners' prayer \u2014 for his mother.[15]\nCardinal Lustiger gained recognition after negotiating in 1987 with representatives of the organized Jewish community (including Th\u00e9o Klein, the former president of the CRIF)[16] the departure of the Carmelite nuns who built a convent in Auschwitz concentration camp (See Auschwitz cross).[2][6] He represented Pope John Paul II in January 2005 during the 60th-year commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz camp by the Allies.[17] He was also in Birkenau along with the new Pope Benedict XVI in May 2006.[18]\nIn 1995, Cardinal Lustiger attended the reading of an act of repentance with a group of French rabbis, during which Catholic authorities apologized for the French Church's passive attitude towards the Collaborationism policies enacted by the Vichy regime during World War II.[6]\nIn 1998, Lustiger was awarded the Nostra Aetate Award for advancing Catholic-Jewish relations by the Center for Christian-Jewish Understanding, an interfaith group housed on the campus of Sacred Heart University, a Catholic university at Fairfield, Connecticut in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group, protested the award, saying it was \"inappropriate\" to honour Lustiger, who was born a Jew but left the faith. \"It's fine to have him speak at a conference or colloquium,\" said the league's national director Abraham Foxman. \"But I don't think he should be honored because he converted out, which makes him a poor example.\" In France, however, Lustiger enjoyed good relations with the Jewish community. Th\u00e9o Klein observed that although conversions usually carry out negative connotations in the Jewish world, it was not so with the Cardinal.[19] Klein called Lustiger \"his cousin .\"[16]\nIn 2006, Lustiger visited Yeshivat Chovevei Torah Rabbinical School and addressed the students and faculty along with fellow visiting European bishops.\nThe World Jewish Congress paid homage to him after his death.[20]\n[edit] Retirement and death\nWhen Lustiger reached the age of 75 in 2001, he delivered his resignation as Archbishop of Paris to Pope John Paul II, as required by canon law. The Pope kept it on file for some years. But on 11 February 2005, Lustiger's retirement was accepted and Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois, a former auxiliary bishop of Paris who had become Archbishop of Tours, succeeded him as Archbishop of Paris.\nLustiger made his final public appearance in January 2007. He died on 5 August 2007 at a clinic outside Paris where he had been battling bone and lung cancer since April. Le Figaro, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, announced Lustiger's death.[6]\nThe funeral, presided over by Cardinal Lustiger's successor, was held at Notre Dame Cathedral on 10 August 2007. Sarkozy, on vacation in the United States, returned to attend Lustiger's funeral.[21][22] In homage to Lustiger's Jewish heritage, the Kaddish \u2013 the traditional hymn of praise of God's name \u2013 was recited by his cousin Arno Lustiger in front of the portal of the cathedral.[22]\nHis epitaph, which he wrote himself in 2004, reads:\n\nI was born Jewish.\nI received the name\nOf my paternal grandfather, Aaron\nHaving become Christian\nBy faith and by Baptism,\nI have remained Jewish\nAs did the Apostles.\nI have as my patron saints\nAaron the High Priest,\nSaint John the Apostle,\nHoly Mary full of grace.\nNamed 139th archbishop of Paris\nby His Holiness Pope John Paul II,\nI was enthroned in this Cathedral\non 27 February 1981,\nAnd here I exercised my entire ministry.\nPassers-by, pray for me.\n\n\n\u2020 Aaron Jean-Marie Cardinal Lustiger\nArchbishop of Paris\n\n[edit] Awards\n\nGrand cordon of the Lebanese Order of the Cedar [23]\nBailli Grand-croix d'honneur et de d\u00e9votion of the Sovereign Order of Malta [23]\nGrand-Cross of the Order of the Infant Henry the Navigator [23]\n\n[edit] Auxiliaries\nAn incomplete list of bishops who served as auxiliaries in the Paris diocese under Cardinal Lustiger would include:\n\nDaniel P\u00e9zeril\n  \nGeorges Gilson\n\n\n Emile Marcus\n \nClaude  Fricard\n\n\n Andr\u00e9 Vingt-Trois\n\n\nEric  L'Aum\u00f4nier\n\nMichel Pollien\n\n\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Beau\n\n[edit] Published works\n\n\n\n\nSermons d'un cur\u00e9 de Paris (1978)\nPain de vie et peuple de Dieu (1981)\nOsez croire (1985)\nOsez vivre (1985)\nPremiers pas dans la pri\u00e8re (1986)\nPrenez place au c\u0153ur de l'\u00c9glise (1986)\nSix sermons aux \u00e9lus de la Nation, 1981-1986 (1987)\nLe Choix de Dieu.

Polish Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He was the Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w from 1978, succeeding Karol Wojty\u0142a to the chair of St. Stanis\u0142aw, until his resignation in 2005. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1979.[1]\nFranciszek was born the youngest of four children in 1927. During World War II he worked as a menial laborer and afterward entered the seminary in Krak\u00f3w, where he also studied theology. He was ordained as a priest in April 1950 by Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha. Until 1956 he was a vicar in a parish near Bielsko-Bia\u0142a and was then transferred to Fribourg, Switzerland to continue his theological studies. He received his doctorate in 1960.[2]\nFather Macharski was appointed Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w in December 1978 by Pope John Paul II, who had been Archbishop of that city himself until his election to the Papacy in October 1978. Macharski was consecrated as a Bishop by John Paul II himself at the Vatican on 6 January 1979 and took possession of the Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w on 28 January 1979, when he was installed at Wawel Cathedral.\nArchbishop Macharski was created Cardinal-Priest of San Giovanni a Porta Latina as his titular church in June 1979, the first consistory on the new pope.[2] This was a mere six months after his episcopal consecration.\nHe was a member of the cardinal electors of the 2005 papal conclave that elected Joseph Alois Ratzinger as Pope Benedict XVI. He turned 80 in May 2007 and as a result passed the maximum age for voting in the conclave.[2]\nCardinal Macharski retired as Archbishop of Krak\u00f3w on 3 June 2005. Upon his resignation being accepted, he became Archbishop emeritus of Krak\u00f3w, and was succeeded in that See by Pope John Paul II's private Secretary, now Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz.\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nKarol Wojty\u0142a\n(Pope John Paul II)\nArchbishop of Krak\u00f3w\n29 December 1978 \u2013 3 June 2005\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nStanis\u0142aw Dziwisz\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nJosef Frings\nCardinal-Priest of San Giovanni a Porta Latina\n30 June 1979 - present\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Gazeta Wyborcza, [1]\n^ a b c Catholic Agency News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 89080081\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nMacharski, Franciszek\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n20 May 1927\n\n\nPlace of birth\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6279/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 31190/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 28913/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 8135/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1700290-0!*!0!*!*!4!* and timestamp 20130228045132 ", "Name": "Franciszek Macharski"}, {"url": "/wiki/Joachim_Meisner", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Joachim Meisner\n\n\nCardinal-Archbishop of Cologne\n\n\n\nOil on canvas by Gerd Mosbach\n\n\nChurch\nCologne Cathedral\n\n\nArchdiocese\nCologne\n\n\nProvince\nCologne\n\n\nMetropolis\nCologne\n\n\nSee\nCologne\n\n\nAppointed\n20 December 1988\n\n\nEnthroned\n12 February 1989\n\n\nPredecessor\nJoseph H\u00f6ffner\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of S.

He is the current Archbishop of Cologne, serving since 1989.[1] He previously served as Bishop of Berlin from 1980 to 1989, and was created a cardinal in 1983.[2] He is widely considered to be Germany's leading conservative Catholic figure.[3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and ordination\n2 Bishop\n3 Views\n\n3.1 Papacy and Magisterium\n3.2 Culture and liturgy\n\n\n4 Quotation\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and ordination\nMeisner was born in Breslau, which was then part of Germany, but is now known as Wroc\u0142aw in southwestern Poland.[6] He studied at the seminary of Erfurt from 1959 to 1962,[6] and was ordained a deacon on 8 April 1962.[7] On 22 December 1962, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Josef Freusberg, an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Fulda.[2]\nBetween 1963 and 1975, Meisner served as chaplain at St. Giles Parish in Heiligenstadt and Holy Cross Parish in Erfurt.[6] He also served as diocesan director of Caritas.[7] During his pastoral ministry, he furthered his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he received his doctorate of theology in 1969.[1]\n[edit] Bishop\nIn 1975, he was elected titular Bishop of Vina and auxiliary bishop to the Apostolic Administrator Erfurt-Meiningen. He was elected as a delegate to the Fourth Synod of Bishops at the Vatican in 1977, where he renewed a friendship with Karol Wojty\u0142a. After Cardinal Wojty\u0142a was elected Pope John Paul II, he appointed Meisner Bishop of Berlin in 1980, and proclaimed him Cardinal-Priest of S. Pudenziana in the consistory of 2 February 1983.\nIn 1988 after the death of Joseph H\u00f6ffner, Meisner was promoted to the position of Archbishop of Cologne, a post he continues to hold. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Meisner was the bishop in charge for the XX. World Youth Day in August 2005 in the archdiocese in Cologne that attracted more than one million people. As the leader of Germany's biggest and wealthiest archdiocese, the Cardinal holds a very significant moral and social position, too.\nMeisner regularly travels to the Vatican to meet Pope Benedict in private.\nOn Tuesday, 18 September 2012, Cardinal Meisner was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI as a Synod Father for the upcoming October 2012 Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops.[8]\nIn February 2013 Cardinal Meisner has approved the use of some morning-after pills for rape victims after he announced they did not induce abortions and could be used in Catholic hospitals. He altered his policy after two Catholic hospitals refused to treat a rape victim because they could not prescribe the pill. The Catholic Church firmly opposes abortion and artificial birth control. Many Catholics see all emergency contraceptives as abortion-inducing drugs banned by this policy, but Meisner said some prevent fertilization and could be used in rape cases. \"The German Bishops' Conference is holding a regular meeting in two weeks and the issue will certainly be on the agenda,\" Cologne archdiocese spokeswoman Nele Harbeke said.[9] [10]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Papacy and Magisterium\nMeisner is known for his support to the Pope and the Church's teachings. Pope John Paul asked for Cardinal Meisner to see him when he was in the Gemelli Hospital in Rome. Meisner had a very close relationship to Pope John Paul II and is a long time friend of Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI.\nHe said of Pope Benedict \"He [Pope Benedict] has the intelligence of 12 professors and is as pious as a child on the day of his first communion.\"[11]\n[edit] Culture and liturgy\n\"Wherever culture is separated from the worship of God, cult atrophies in ritualism and culture becomes degenerate\", said Meisner at the blessing of his own archdiocese's new art museum, the Kolumba, on 14 September 2007. His choice of words recalled the phrase \"entartete Kunst\" (\"degenerate art\") used as the title of the exhibition opened by Adolf Hitler in Munich on 19 July 1937 and provoked strong negative reaction.[12]\nIt was widely recognized that Meisner was venting his anger about the stained-glass window in Cologne Cathedral by Gerhard Richter, which was revealed just weeks before and of which he disapproved.[13][14][15]\n[edit] Quotation\n\n\"We as Catholic Christians do always have a reason for hope.

He was created a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in the 2001 Consistory. He submitted his resignation upon reaching his 75th birthday, and it was accepted on 3 April 2009 when Pope Benedict appointed Vincent Nichols as the new archbishop.[2]\nBy virtue of his position as Archbishop of Westminster, he was sometimes referred to as the Catholic Primate of England and Wales. However, though the holders, within the Church of England, of the posts of Archbishop of Canterbury and Archbishop of York are called the \"Primate of All England\" and \"Primate of England\", the title of primate has not been accorded to the leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life\n2 Church career\n\n2.1 Parish priest\n2.2 Bishop\n2.3 Cardinal-Archbishop\n2.4 Retirement\n\n\n3 Views\n\n3.1 Abuse scandal\n3.2 Employment issues\n3.3 Response to Summorum Pontificum\n3.4 AIDS prevention\n3.5 Illegal immigrants\n3.6 Gay adoption\n3.7 Family planning\n3.8 Embryo Bill\n3.9 Atheism\n\n\n4 Footnotes\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life\nCormac Murphy-O'Connor was born in Reading, Berkshire, the fifth son of George and Ellen Murphy-O'Connor (d.1971), who emigrated from County Cork in Ireland before World War I and married in 1921.[3] Two of his uncles, one aunt, two cousins, and two of his brothers, Brian (died 2012)[4] and Patrick, also entered religion. His youngest brother, John, was a regular officer in the Royal Artillery who died at age 32 for reasons which have never been clarified; he has two other siblings, James (a doctor and rugby player) and Catherine. After attending Presentation College in Reading, and Prior Park College in Bath, Murphy-O'Connor then began his studies for the priesthood in 1950 at the Venerable English College in Rome, where he received a degree in theology. Thereafter, he earned a licentiate in philosophy and a licentiate in sacred theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was ordained on 28 October 1956, by Valerio Cardinal Valeri. For the next decade he did pastoral work in Portsmouth and Fareham.[1]\n[edit] Church career\n[edit] Parish priest\nIn 1966, Murphy-O'Connor became the private secretary to Bishop Derek Worlock of Portsmouth. In September 1970, he was appointed parish priest of the Immaculate Conception church in Portswood, Southampton. Soon afterwards, in late 1971, he was appointed rector of the Venerable English College,[1] his alma mater. As rector he hosted the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Donald Coggan, on his historic visit to Pope Paul VI in 1977. He was elevated to the rank of Monsignor on 10 March 1972.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn 17 November 1977, Murphy-O'Connor was named Bishop of Arundel and Brighton. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 21 December from Bishop Michael Bowen, with Archbishop George Dwyer and Bishop Anthony Emery serving as co-consecrators. He held important positions among the bishops of Europe and has also been consistently influential in ecumenical work; from 1982 to 2000 he was Co-Chairman of the Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC). In 2000 he was awarded the Lambeth degree of Doctorate in Divinity by then Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, in recognition of his work for Christian unity.\n[edit] Cardinal-Archbishop\n\n\nStyles of\nCormac Murphy-O'Connor\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nWestminster (emeritus)\n\n\nMurphy-O'Connor was appointed the tenth Archbishop of Westminster, and thus head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, on 15 February 2000, and in November of that year he was elected President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales.\nIn the consistory of 21 February 2001, he was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria sopra Minerva by Pope John Paul II.\nAs a new cardinal he was appointed to four Curial organisations: the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See, the Pontifical Council for the Study of Organisational and Economic Problems of the Holy See, and the Pontifical Council for the Family. He also sits on the Pontifical Councils for Culture and for Laity, and was secretary of the Vox Clara commission which oversees the translating of liturgical texts from Latin into English. He remains active in these positions until his 80th birthday in 2012.\nIn August 2001, Murphy-O'Connor was created a Freeman of the City of London.\nIn 2002, in Westminster Abbey he was the first cardinal to read prayers at an English Royal Funeral Service (for the Queen Mother) since 1509. In 2002 he had his portrait painted for Westminster Cathedral by the artist Christian Furr.[5] He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI, but is ineligible to participate in the next on grounds of age.\nOn 28 October 2006, Murphy-O'Connor celebrated 50 years of ordination with a Jubilee Mass in Westminster Cathedral.[6]\n[edit] Retirement\nShortly before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, Murphy-O'Connor submitted his resignation as Archbishop of Westminster to Pope Benedict XVI, who asked that Murphy-O'Connor remain in his position \"until he chooses otherwise\". Murphy-O'Connor said in a subsequent letter to his clergy, \"I am very content to accept the Holy Father\u2019s request.\"[7] On 3 April 2009, Pope Benedict appointed Vincent Nichols as Murphy-O'Connor's replacement. Thus, since all of Murphy O'Connor's predecessors died in office, he is the first to become Archbishop Emeritus of Westminster. He now lives in semi-retirement in Duke's Avenue, Chiswick, London.\nOn 30 October 2009, in addition to his other duties in Rome, Pope Benedict appointed Murphy-O'Connor as a member of the Congregation for Bishops, where he served until his 80th birthday. It was unusual to receive such an appointment after retirement.[8][9]\nIn June 2010, after the Ryan Report and Murphy Report on the abuses by the Catholic Church in Ireland, Murphy-O'Connor was named along with others to oversee the apostolic visitation of certain dioceses and seminaries. Murphy-O'Connor was named as the Visitor to the Diocese of Armagh and its suffragan sees. He will report back to the Holy See on what steps have been taken since the reports were issued, and what else needs to happen.\nMurphy-O\u2019Connor, in a speech delivered on 17 May 2012 in Leicester\u2019s Anglican cathedral, said, \u201cIn the name of tolerance it seems to me tolerance is being abolished.\u201d He had strong words regarding the effect that secularists have had in the UK. \"Our danger in Britain today is that so-called Western reason claims that it alone has recognized what is right and thus claims a totality that is inimical to freedom\", he said. \"No one is forced to be a Christian. But no one should be forced to live according to the new secular religion as if it alone were definitive and obligatory for all humankind.\" and \"The propaganda of secularism and its high priests wants us to believe that religion is dangerous for our health. It suits them to have no opposition to their vision of a brave new world, the world which they see as somehow governed only by people like themselves.\u201d[10]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Abuse scandal\nMain article: Sexual abuse scandal in Arundel and Brighton diocese\nMurphy-O'Connor found himself subject to public scrutiny regarding a priest in his diocese when he was Bishop of Arundel and Brighton. During this time it was brought to his attention that a priest, Michael Hill, was a child sexual abuser. In 2000, when O'Connor became Archbishop of Westminster, the case became known to the general public.[11]\n[edit] Employment issues\nIn 2006, it was alleged in the Daily Mail that Murphy-O'Connor had fired his press aide Stephen Noon for being gay, believing that Noon's sexuality was \u201cincompatible\u201d with his position in the Church. As yet, this has not been tested in a court of law or tribunal.[12]\n[edit] Response to Summorum Pontificum\nIn November 2007, Murphy-O'Connor issued a letter to the clergy of his diocese regarding Pope Benedict XVI's motu proprio Summorum Pontificum relaxing of the restrictions on the use of the 1962 Roman Missal. Some interpreted the letter as contradicting the motu proprio's assigning to the rectors of churches the right to grant the required permission for public celebration of Mass according to that final version of the Tridentine Mass.\nDamian Thompson, the editor of the Catholic Herald, commented that Murphy-O'Connor \"begins by announcing that the Pope's purpose in removing restrictions on the Tridentine Mass was 'to restore unity within the Church \u2013 both to enable those who truly desire unity to remain in that unity and to offer those who have not yet accepted the liturgical reforms and teachings of the Second Vatican Council a way back to full communion with the Church.'\"[citation needed] And in his blog What Does the Prayer Really Say? Fr. John Zuhlsdorf said that Murphy-O'Connor's comments constituted \"a horribly narrow and inaccurate way of reading the Holy Father\u2019s provisions\", and claimed that a comment by Archbishop Malcolm Ranjith, that \"some dioceses, even interpretative documents which inexplicably aim at putting limits on the Pope\u2019s Motu Proprio\" are motivated by \"pride, one of the gravest sins\", was a response to documents such as Murphy-O'Connor's.[13]\n[edit] AIDS prevention\nMain article: Religion and AIDS\nOn 3 December 2006, Murphy-O'Connor issued a response to a statement made by Prime Minister Tony Blair on World AIDS Day (1 December 2006) in which Blair said, \"The danger is if we have a sort of blanket ban from religious hierarchy saying it's wrong to do it, then you discourage people from doing it in circumstances where they need to protect their lives.\" In response to this Murphy-O'Connor said, \"I think what I would like to say to the prime minister is that it would be much better if he used that money to provide more antiretroviral drugs \u2013 medicines \u2013 for the millions of children, women who are affected. I speak to bishops in Africa and they tell me that their dioceses are flooded with condoms and I said, 'Well, has it affected?' They said, 'Well, sad to say it has meant more promiscuity and more AIDS'\".[14]\n[edit] Illegal immigrants\nOn 7 May 2007, Murphy-O'Connor addressed a crowd of illegal immigrants in Trafalgar Square in support of the Strangers into Citizens campaign, which is calling for a path into citizenship for undocumented workers. Previously he had commissioned major research on the pastoral challenges of migrants in his parishes and this had been published to front page coverage in The Times and leader coverage internationally as The Ground of Justice written by Francis Davis and Jolanta Stankeviciute who are now based at the Las Casas Institute, Blackfriars Hall, University of Oxford.[15]\n[edit] Gay adoption\nIn early 2007 Murphy-O'Connor sent a letter to Blair over the impending regulations that the rights of gay couples extend to an equal opportunity relating to adoption. He said that the law would force people to \"act against the teaching of the Church and their own consciences\" with regard to Catholic adoption agencies and requested an exemption from the law. The Cardinal continued, saying, \"We believe it would be unreasonable, unnecessary and unjust discrimination against Catholics for the government to insist that if they wish to continue to work with local authorities, Catholic adoption agencies must act against the teaching of the Church and their own consciences by being obliged in law to provide such a service.\"[16]\n[edit] Family planning\nMurphy-O\u2019Connor has denounced contraception and abortion many times. In February 2008 he sacked the board of St John and St Elizabeth\u2019s, a partly NHS funded Catholic hospital, after it had permitted a GP\u2019s surgery to move onto the site and administer family planning.[17]\nIn February 2013, Murphy-O\u2019Connor said that while a radical departure from previous teaching was not likely, it would be \u201cwise\u201d to focus on \"what's good and what's true\" about marriage and family life instead. He said that Catholic teaching on sexuality should steer away from saying \"we condemn this, we condemn that\". \u201cI think that every Pope will face what needs to be faced and with regard to contraception I think the Pope won\u2019t say the Church has been wrong the whole time. He\u2019ll be saying there are ways\u2026I think the Pope will be as every other Pope has, particularly Pope Benedict, understanding that the fundamental teaching on sexuality is concentrated on marriage, on family life. \u201cI think that the Church would be wise actually to focus on that in her teaching, rather than saying \u2018we condemn this, we condemn that, or the other\u2019. No \u2013 focus on what\u2019s good and what\u2019s true.\u201d[18]\n[edit] Embryo Bill\nIn March 2008 Murphy-O'Connor joined Cardinal Keith O'Brien of Scotland in opposing the Government's proposed Embryology Bill. The Government had instructed its MPs to vote for the bill which angered some Catholic members, Murphy-O'Connor said \"Certainly, there are some aspects of this bill on which I believe there ought to be a free vote, because Catholics and others will want to vote according to their conscience.\" The Government gave in to the pressure and promised to allow MPs a free vote.[19]\n[edit] Atheism\nIn 2008, Murphy-O'Connor urged Christians to treat atheists and agnostics with deep esteem, \"because the hidden God is active in their lives as well as in the lives of those who believe\".[20] However, in 2009, speaking after Archbishop Vincent Nichols' installation, he said that a lack of faith is \"the greatest of evils.\" He blamed atheism for war and destruction, and implied it was a greater evil even than sin itself.[21][22]\n[edit] Footnotes\n\n\n^ a b c d e Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor: recession may be jolt that selfish Britain needs\n^ Miranda, Salvador. \"Cormac Murphy-O'Connor\".

He served as the Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh from 1985 to 2013. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 2003.\nCardinal O'Brien was the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland[1][2] and had been the head of its Conference of Bishops. In November 2012, he tendered his resignation from the governance of the Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh in view of his forthcoming 75th birthday, which was definitively accepted by the Pope on 18 February 2013 and made public on 25 February 2013.[3] The announcement of his resignation followed allegations of inappropriate conduct with junior clergy in the 1980s.[4]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life\n2 Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh\n\n2.1 Curial appointments\n\n\n3 Missionary interest\n4 Views\n\n4.1 Scottish independence\n4.2 Homosexuality\n4.3 Politicians who support abortion\n4.4 Embryo bill\n4.5 New Labour\n4.6 British foreign policy\n4.7 Act of Settlement of 1701\n4.8 Married priests\n\n\n5 Alleged inappropriate acts and resignation as Archbishop\n6 Health\n7 References\n8 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life\nO\u2019Brien was born at Ballycastle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, on 17 March 1938. After primary education in Ballycastle, he moved with his family to Scotland where his father was serving with the Royal Navy at Faslane, initially attending St Stephen's Primary School, Dalmuir before continuing to secondary school at St Patrick\u2019s High School, Dumbarton. His family then moved to Edinburgh, where he completed his secondary education at Holy Cross Academy, before studying at the University of Edinburgh where he gained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry in 1959 (and later a Diploma in Education in 1966). His studies for the Priesthood were at St Andrew's College, Drygrange, Roxburghshire, and he was ordained priest on 3 April 1965 by his predecessor, Cardinal Gordon Gray. Initially, serving as curate at Holy Cross, Edinburgh from 1965 until 1966, he completed his teacher training certificate at Moray House College of Education. For the next 5 years, from 1966 to 1971, he was employed by Fife County Council as a teacher of mathematics and science; he also served as chaplain to St Columba's Secondary School, initially in Cowdenbeath and then in Dunfermline, while assisting at St Bride's Parish, Cowdenbeath.\nHe was then moved to full-time parish apostolate in St Patrick's, Kilsyth from 1972 until 1975 and then St Mary's, Bathgate from 1975 until 1978. He served as spiritual director to the students at St Andrew\u2019s College, Drygrange from 1978 until 1980 then as Rector of St Mary\u2019s College, Blairs, the junior seminary near Aberdeen, from 1980 until 1985.\n[edit] Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh\nCardinal O\u2019Brien was nominated archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh on 30 May 1985 and was ordained to the episcopate by Cardinal Gray, then Archbishop Emeritus of St Andrews and Edinburgh, at St Mary\u2019s Cathedral, Edinburgh on 5 August 1985. Pope John Paul II created him Cardinal-Priest of Ss Joachim and Anne ad Tusculanum on 21 October 2003.\nThe Cardinal was made Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in 2005, appointed Grand Prior of the Scottish Lieutenancy of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem in 2001 and appointed Knight Grand Cross (KGCHS) of that order in 2003.\nO'Brien was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws from St Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada in 2004; awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of St Andrews in 2004 and awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of Edinburgh also in 2004.\nHe was Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Argyll and the Isles from 1996 until 1999 when Bishop Ian Murray took over the diocese.\nO'Brien took part in the 2005 Papal Conclave which elected Pope Benedict XVI.\nIn anticipation of the 2010 visit of Pope Benedict to England and Scotland, O'Brien and Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, said that the crisis involving Se\u00e1n Brady, Archbishop of Armagh, over the priest Brendan Smyth and other clerical abuse charges is one for the Irish Catholic Church and should not overshadow Pope Benedict\u2019s visit. O\u2019Brien and Vincent Nichols were asked whether the pope will respond to charges made against the church about clerical sex abuse during his four-day visit\u00a0\u2013 the first papal visit to the United Kingdom since Pope John Paul II came in 1982.\n\u201cWe do not know whether he will address that subject. We are quite a different country from Ireland, or France or wherever else. Basically, I do not know whether he will address that particular subject,\u201d said Cardinal O\u2019Brien, while Archbishop Nichols said English, Welsh and Scottish bishops have \u201crobust\u201d rules in place to protect children.[5]\nO'Brien initially intended to take part in the 2013 conclave to elect the successor to Pope Benedict XVI,[6] but he cancelled his participation due to his resignation in February that year.[3]\n[edit] Curial appointments\nAfter his creation as cardinal, O\u2019Brien was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications and also a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People.\nHe is currently the President of the Bishops\u2019 Conference of Scotland and fulfils various engagements at the request of other members of the Conference.\nHe is sometimes referred to by non-Scots as the \"Primate of Scotland\",[7] however no such title has ever been officially bestowed upon him and there is no precedent in Scotland for the position of primate.\n[edit] Missionary interest\n\n\n\n\n\"Serve the Lord with Gladness\"\n\n\nO'Brien has always shown a keen interest in the foreign missions, having visited the territory previously adopted by his own Archdiocese\u00a0\u2013 Bauchi in northern Nigeria\u00a0\u2013 on two occasions. He has also visited his priests who are on loan to dioceses in Central America, having visited El Salvador on three occasions and Chiapas in Mexico on two occasions, as well as going to Guatemala.\nAs a director of the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (SCIAF), the Cardinal has visited projects funded from Scotland in successive years: Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2004, Ethiopia in 2005, and Darfur in Sudan in 2006. During the same year, O'Brien promoted various projects in the Diocese of Moshi in Tanzania which are supported by Holy Rood High School and the parish of St John in Portobello. He also visited India early in 2007, and has been invited to visit Beijing and Shanghai in China and Hanoi in Vietnam.\n[edit] Views\nSometimes known as the \"Cardinal of Controversy\"[8] O'Brien often speaks on issues close to his heart with frankness. In 1999, at the European Synod of Bishops, O'Brien answered whom he saw fit as the next Archbishop of Westminster, following the death of Cardinal Basil Hume O.S.B.. Usually bishops handle this type of questions very diplomatically, if at all. O'Brien bluntly named his candidate: Father Timothy Radcliffe, Master General of the Dominican Order (Black Friars). At this Synod, Radcliffe had made an intervention to O'Brien's heart. There is a crisis of authority going in the Church, Radcliffe had said, but the answer cannot be more emphasis on authority. In presence of the Pope, Radcliffe went on: the Church should not only speak about the poor, the divorced people, women who had had an abortion, homosexuals, but also take at heart their experiences, eat their bread, take what they have to offer. 'They'll blame us being associated with the wrong people but we have a good precedent'.[9]\n[edit] Scottish independence\nIn an interview with the University of St Andrews philosopher Professor John Haldane, published in the Catholic Herald in October 2006, O'Brien stated that he would be \"happy\" if Scots voted for independence, and predicted that independence is coming \"before too long\". He drew parallels with the independence of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland: \"it is difficult to argue that ecclesiastical independence is acceptable but political independence is not\".[10]\n[edit] Homosexuality\nBefore elevation to cardinal, O'Brien was regarded as liberal on the issue of homosexuality, noting the number of homosexual priests in the Church.[11] In 2005 O'Brien rebuked Bishop Joseph Devine who had suggested that homosexuals should not be allowed to teach in Catholic schools commenting, \"I don\u2019t have a problem with the personal life of a person as long as they are not flaunting their sexuality\".[12]\nIn May 2005 he told members of the Scottish Parliament that homosexuals were \"captives of sexual aberrations\", comparing homosexuals to prisoners in Saughton jail.[13] In January 2006 he criticised Westminster MPs over the introduction of civil partnerships in the UK, and Holyrood members over the liberalisation of divorce laws in Scotland,[14] In July 2006 he opposed proposals to change the law which would require Catholic adoption agencies to place children with homosexuals in the same way as with heterosexuals, calling them totalitarian.[15][dubious \u2013 discuss] In 2011 he criticised \"aggressive secularism\" denouncing what he claimed was the way Christians had been prevented from acting in accordance with their beliefs because they refuse to endorse such lifestyles.[16]\nIn December 2011, O'Brien reiterated the Catholic Church's continued opposition to civil partnerships and suggested that there should be no laws that 'facilitate' same-sex relationships, which he claimed were \"harmful\", arguing; \u201cThe empirical evidence is clear, same-sex relationships are demonstrably harmful to the medical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing of those involved, no compassionate society should ever enact legislation to facilitate or promote such relationships, we have failed those who struggle with same-sex attraction and wider society by our actions.\u201d[17]\nOn 5 March 2012, O'Brien criticised the concept of same-sex marriage on BBC Radio 4, saying it would shame the United Kingdom[18] and that promoting such things would degenerate society further.[19] Conservative MP Margot James, who was considered one of the most influential gay men and women in 2009,[20] called these comments \"scaremongering\" and said: \"I think it is a completely unacceptable way for a prelate to talk. I think that the government is not trying to force Catholic churches to perform gay marriages at all. It is a purely civil matter.\" Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Harriet Harman said, \"We have had prejudice, discrimination and homophobia for hundreds of years. That doesn't make it right [...] I don't want anybody to feel that this is a licence for whipping up prejudice.\"[21] Dan Hodges wrote: \"I can't remember the last time I read a more morally and intellectually bankrupt rant from a senior member of the clergy.\"[22] Stonewall, a London-based lobbying group against attacks on lesbians, gay men and bisexuals,[23] awarded O'Brien \"Bigot of the Year\" at their annual awards in November 2012.[24] The award was criticised by the first minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, as being \"clearly wrong\" and \"not conducive to a proper and dignified debate on the important issue of equality in Scotland\".[25] Similarly, Stonewall sponsors, Barclays, threatened to withdraw funding if the award was not discontinued.\nOn 23 February 2013 The Observer published accounts of four male members of the Scottish Catholic clergy (priests either now or in the past) claiming that in the early 1980s Cardinal O'Brien had abused his position as a member of the church hierarchy by making unwanted homosexual advances towards them.[26] (See Alleged \"inappropriate acts\" below.)\n[edit] Politicians who support abortion\nIn May 2007 he urged Catholics to reject political candidates who support what he called the \"social evil\" of abortion, and said that such Catholic politicians should not expect to remain full members of the Church.[27]\n[edit] Embryo bill\nDuring March 2008 O'Brien highlighted the issue of an Embryo Bill facing parliament, denouncing the government for a \"monstrous attack on human rights\" through its \"evil\" endorsement of \"Frankenstein\" experiments. Some scientists suggested that the Cardinal intentionally used inflammatory language to stir up opposition to the bill; however others argued he was sticking up for morals and forced the Government to allow MPs to vote freely on the issue. (Gordon Brown had originally imposed a three-line whip on Labour MPs, meaning they had to back the bill, regardless of personal convictions.)[28][29][30]\nThe Cardinal posted a video on YouTube in which he put forward his beliefs concerning the Human Embryology & Fertilisation Bill. The short video was also put on DVD and sent to every MP in parliament.[31] In the video O'Brien makes clear that he is not against medical research\u00a0\u2013 in fact he supports research with adult Stem Cells\u00a0\u2014 but he is opposed to the using of embryos which will be destroyed after experimentation. He also voiced concerns over \"human-animal hybrids\" in the video.\n[edit] New Labour\nIn February 2010, the Secretary of State for Scotland, Jim Murphy, stated that faith was \"at the very foundations of the Labour Party.\"[32] O'Brien responded to this claim by saying he \"welcomed the sentiment\" but pointed out that \"a tangible example by the Government over the last decade that it acknowledged or endorsed religious values would also have been welcomed. Instead we have witnessed this Government undertake a systematic and unrelenting attack on family values.\"[33] The Archbishop went on to reveal that he had told Scottish Labour Leader, Iain Gray, \"I hope he [Pope Benedict XVI] gives you hell for what has happened over the past 10 years'.\" This was a reference to the Pope's visit due to take place in September 2010.[34][35]\n[edit] British foreign policy\nIn March 2011 O'Brien called British foreign policy \"anti-Christian\" for greatly increasing aid to Pakistan without requiring any commitment from the Pakistani government to religious freedom for Christians and other minorities. He made this statement in the wake of the assassination of Pakistani minister Shahbaz Bhatti, who had spoken out against the country's blasphemy law.[36]\n[edit] Act of Settlement of 1701\nHe has called for a 310-year-old law banning Catholics from taking the throne to be repealed. Cardinal O'Brien said the Act of Settlement of 1701 was hampering efforts to curb sectarianism. Prime Minister David Cameron has said that \"in principle\" he supports reforming the law on royal succession to allow first-born female heirs to take the throne and remove the ban on Catholics becoming king or queen or marrying the heir to the throne.[37]\nHis comments came after First Minister Alex Salmond described sectarianism as a parasite in the game of football.\nCardinal O'Brien claimed the law amounted to sectarianism as much as chanting bigoted songs on the terraces.\n[edit] Married priests\nOn 22 February 2013, in an interview with the BBC, Cardinal O'Brien discussed the possibility that there would be a rethink on the rules to allow Roman Catholic priests to be married.[38]\n[edit] Alleged inappropriate acts and resignation as Archbishop\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the Press gather outside Cardinal O'Brien's residence in Edinburgh on the day of his resignation.\n\n\nOn 23 February 2013, it was reported by The Observer[26] that Cardinal O'Brien had been accused of inappropriate behaviour involving three serving priests and one former priest within the Diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh dating back to the 1980s. The complaint demanding his immediate resignation was lodged with the Vatican's ambassador to the United Kingdom. The Cardinal contested the allegations. On 24 February 2013, O'Brien failed to attend a special service to celebrate the eight-year tenure of Pope Benedict XVI at St Mary's RC Cathedral, Edinburgh. It was widely reported that he had sought legal advice and been advised not to attend.[39]\nOn 25 February 2013, it was announced that O'Brien had resigned as Archbishop and would not participate in the forthcoming conclave.[4]\n[edit] Health\nO'Brien has long been suffering from heart problems and was fitted with a pacemaker after complaining of dizzy spells and fainting prior to Passion Sunday Mass in March 2008.[40]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Cardinal O'Brien, the Church's leader in Scotland, The Daily Telegraph, 18 April 2008\n^ He was the leader of Scotland\u2019s 800,000 or so Catholics, Interview \u2013 Cardinal Keith O'Brien, Holyrood Magazine, 8 June 2007\n^ a b \"Cardinal Keith O'Brien resignation: Statement in full\".

He received his episcopal consecration on January 6, 1991 from John Paul II himself, with Archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Justin Francis Rigali serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter's Basilica.\nFollowing the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, Pulji\u0107 became involved in helping the thousands of refugees and exiles and advocated human rights.\nPulji\u0107 was created Cardinal Priest of S. Chiara a Vigna Clara by John Paul II in the consistory of November 26, 1994. On October 18, 2001, he was invested as bailiff of the Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion in the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Pulji\u0107 was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XVI. He served as President of the Bishops' Conference of Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1995 to 2002, and again from 2005 to the present. On Tuesday, September 18, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named him as a Synod Father of the upcoming October 2012 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops.[1]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Role during the Bosnian conflict\nDuring the war, he frequently risked his life while making pastoral trips to his parishes; he was imprisoned during one visit for twelve hours by the Serbian military in Ilija\u0161, running a serious risk when he rode in a United Nations Protection Force tank to Vare\u0161. John Paul II once said to him, \"When I imposed hands on you...to consecrate you in the office of Pastor of the Church of Sarajevo, I had no idea that very shortly your cross would be so heavy and your cup so bitter.\"\n[edit] Status of Medjugorje\nCardinal Vinko Puljic of Sarajevo, speaking at the 2004 assembly of the Synod of Bishops, complained that the reported apparitions of Medjugorje were becoming a source of division in the Church,[2] and was involved in setting up in 2006 of a commission to examine the alleged Marian apparitions.[3]\n[edit] Relations with Muslims\nCardinal Pulji\u0107 has said that before the war, relations with Muslims were very good, but that in recent times, the situation has somewhat deteriorated. The first sign was the arrival of humanitarian aid from Arab countries\u00a0: it was distributed only to Muslims, while at the same time it was prohibited to give it to Christians.[4]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Nomina di Padri sinodali della XIII Assemblea Generale Ordinaria del Sinodo dei Vescovi (7-28 ottobre 2012) [Appointment of Fathers of the XIII Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops (October 7-28, 2012)]\" (in Italian).

He has four siblings: Visitaci\u00f3n, Jose, Manuel, and Eugenia. He studied at the seminary in Mondo\u00f1edo and at the Pontifical University of Salamanca (1954\u20131958), from where he obtained his licentiate in theology. Rouco was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Francisco Barbado y Viejo, OP, on 28 March 1959.\nHe then furthered his studies at the University of Munich, earning a doctorate in canon law in 1964 with a dissertation on church-state relations in 16th century Spain.

He invites them \"for a profound, authentic and joyful encounter with Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, who calls young people in his Church so that their lives, often depressed and broken, and others fresh and vigorous, will be rooted and built up in Him, the only one who can offer them and give them truth, hope and love; the only one who can show them the right direction and accompany them on the way that leads to genuine and lasting happiness\" as he wrote in a letter just before the World Youth Day of 2011.\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Article of ABC journal\n^ Cardinalrating.com\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nBiography at catholic-pages.com\n\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAngel Suqu\u00eda Goicoechea\nArchbishop of Madrid\n28 July 1994\u2013incumbent\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nRouco Varela, Antonio\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n24 August 1936\n\n\nPlace of birth\nVilalba, Galicia, Spanish Republic\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6358/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 26512/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 31626/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 12743/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1801010-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130228045141 ", "Name": "Antonio Mar\u00eda Rouco Varela"}, {"url": "/wiki/Christoph_Sch%C3%B6nborn", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence Cardinal\u00a0\nChristoph Sch\u00f6nborn,\u00a0O.P.\n\n\nArchbishop of Vienna\n\n\n\nCardinal Sch\u00f6nborn in Alt\u00f6tting on the day Pope Benedict XVI visited the town.\n\n\nArchdiocese\nVienna\n\n\nEnthroned\n14 September 1995\n\n\nPredecessor\nHans Hermann Gro\u00ebr\n\n\nOther posts\nAuxiliary Bishop of Vienna and Titular Bishop of Sutrium (1991\u20131995); Coadjutor Archbishop of Vienna (April\u2013September 1995)\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nOrdination\n27 December 1970 (Priest)\n\n\nConsecration\n29 September 1991 (Bishop)\n\n\nCreated Cardinal\n21 February 1998\n\n\nRank\nCardinal-Priest of Ges\u00f9 Divin Lavoratore\n\n\nPersonal details\n\n\nBorn\n(1945-01-22) 22 January 1945 (age\u00a068)\nSkalken Castle, Bohemia, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic)\n\n\nNationality\nAustrian\n\n\nDenomination\nRoman Catholic Church\n\n\nParents\nCount Hugo-Damian von Sch\u00f6nborn and Baroness Eleonore von Doblhoff\n\n\nMotto\n\n\n\nVos Autem Dixi Amicos\n(I have called you friends)\n\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\n\n\n\nStyles of\nChristoph Sch\u00f6nborn\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nChristoph Maria Michael Hugo Damian Peter Adalbert (Graf von) Sch\u00f6nborn, OP (born 22 January 1945) is a Bohemian-born Austrian cardinal of the Catholic Church and theologian. He currently serves as the Archbishop of Vienna and President of the Austrian Bishops Conference. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1998. He is also the chaplain of the Order of the Golden Fleece (Austrian branch), of which he has been a member since 1961. He is a member of the formerly sovereign princely House of Sch\u00f6nborn. He is seen as a leading candidate for the papacy because he is conservative, albeit a \"balanced reformer\" who is well liked by all factions of the church[1] and noted for his tolerant views.[2] Sch\u00f6nborn has travelled widely and is well known in the Catholic Church globally for editing the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He is a former student of Pope Benedict XVI and a close confidant, ally and long-time friend.[1] He has German Bohemian, Czech, Austrian and Irish ancestry, has studied in France and been a Professor for several years in Switzerland, and speaks six languages.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Family and early life\n2 Early church career\n3 Archbishop of Vienna\n\n3.1 Response to sex abuse\n\n\n4 Views\n\n4.1 Islam and Catholicism\n4.2 Catholic-Orthodox dialogue\n4.3 HIV/AIDS and condoms\n4.4 Mozart, Catholicism and Freemasonry\n4.5 Evolution and the Catholic Church\n\n\n5 Coat of arms\n6 Ancestry\n7 See also\n8 References\n9 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Family and early life\nMain article: House of Sch\u00f6nborn\n\n\n\n\nHis birthplace and ancestral castle, Skalka Castle in modern Vlastislav\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLady Selina Meade (1797\u20131872), married Countess of Clam-Martinic, painted by Thomas Lawrence\n\n\nChristoph Maria Michael Hugo Damian Peter Adalbert Graf von Sch\u00f6nborn was born at Skalka Castle, west of Litom\u011b\u0159ice, Bohemia in Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic), the second son of the Count Maria Hugo Damian Adalbert Josef Hubertus von Sch\u00f6nborn and Baroness Eleonore Ottilie Hilda Maria von Doblhoff. He is a member of the House of Sch\u00f6nborn and descends from some of the leading aristostratic families of Bohemia and other lands of the Habsburg Empire of both German Bohemian, Czech Bohemian and German Austrian origin, including Lobkowicz, Chotek, Wurmbrand-Stuppach and Clam-Martinic. The counts of Sch\u00f6nborn became lords of the lordship of Skalken in Bohemia in 1796 and were owners of the lordship until a land reform in 1923. The Sch\u00f6nborn family continued to live in the local castle until 1945. His family spoke German as their primary language and Czech as a secondary language; in Skalken around half of the population were native German speakers and the other half native Czech speakers and most people spoke both languages. During the war, his father Hugo Damian was involved in the anti-Nazi resistance. After 1945, Bohemia's large German-speaking population (especially the nobility) was persecuted by the new communist rulers, and the family fled to Austria when Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn was nine months old.[3] His parents divorced in 1959. He has two brothers and one sister. Several members of the Sch\u00f6nborn family held high offices in the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire from the 17th century, including several prince-bishops, cardinals and ecclesiastical prince-electors.[4] His legal birth name is Christoph (Maria Michael Hugo Damian Peter Adalbert) Graf von Sch\u00f6nborn, the name under which he is still often referred to, while Austrian authorities registered him under the name \"Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn.\" Despite growing up in Vienna, he has said that Bohemia is his home.[3]\nChristoph Sch\u00f6nborn also descends from the astronomers Joseph Johann Littrow and Karl L. Littrow, and the feminist pioneer Auguste von Littrow. He also has an Irish great-great-great-grandmother, Lady Selina Meade (1797\u20131872), the daughter of Richard Meade, 2nd Earl of Clanwilliam (1766\u20131805), married Countess of Clam-Martinic. Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn is a relative of Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg.\nIn addition to his native German, he is fluent in French, Italian, English, Spanish and Latin.[5] He lived for several years in France and French-speaking Switzerland, and speaks French at a near-native level.\n[edit] Early church career\nIn September 1945, his family was forced to flee from Bohemia. Sch\u00f6nborn took his Matura examination in 1963, and entered the Order of Preachers. He studied theology in Paris; and philosophy and psychology in Bornheim-Walberberg and Vienna. Sch\u00f6nborn also attended the Catholic Institute of Paris for further theological work, before studying Slavic and Byzantine Christianity at the Sorbonne.\nHe was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Franz K\u00f6nig on 27 December 1970 in Vienna. Sch\u00f6nborn obtained a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1971, and later studied in Regensburg under Fr. Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI). He subsequently completed a doctorate in Sacred Theology in Paris. From 1975 he was Professor of Dogmatics at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. In 1980, he became a member of the International Theological Commission of the Holy See, and in 1987 he became editorial secretary for the Catechism of the Catholic Church. In 1991 he was chosen to become an auxiliary bishop of Vienna.\n[edit] Archbishop of Vienna\nHe was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Vienna on 11 April 1995 and succeeded as Archbishop of Vienna on 14 September 1995. He was created Cardinal-Priest of Ges\u00f9 Divin Lavoratore by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 1998. Considered among the papabili following John Paul's death, Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn remains eligible to vote in any future papal conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on 22 January 2025.\nHe serves as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, that for the Oriental Churches, and that for Catholic Education, and of the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church. On 5 January 2011 he was appointed among the first members of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.[6]\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Sch\u00f6rnborn (with crosier) walking in the Otto von Habsburg funeral procession\n\n\nCardinal Sch\u00f6nborn also serves as the chaplain to the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece. Sch\u00f6nborn's episcopal motto is Vos autem dixi amicos (I have called you friends) from John 15:15.\nCardinal Sch\u00f6nborn presided over the requiem for Otto of Habsburg, former Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary, in St. Stephen's Cathedral on 16 July 2011.[7]\nOn Tuesday, 18 September 2012, Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn was named by Pope Benedict XVI as a Synod Father for the upcoming October 2012 13th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization.[8]\nHe is the highest-ranked Catholic Church official to visit Iran after the 1980\u201388 Iran-Iraq War.[9]\nHe has been described as an accomplished crisis manager.[10]\n[edit] Response to sex abuse\nIn May 2010 Sch\u00f6nborn told the Austrian Catholic news agency Kathpress, \"the days of cover-up are over. For a long while the Church's principle of forgiveness was falsely interpreted and was in favour of those responsible and not the victims,\" while praising Pope Benedict XVI for having pushed for sex abuse inquiries when he was a Cardinal. Sch\u00f6nborn has earned much recognition[11] for his handling of the abuse scandal surrounding former Vienna Archbishop Hans Hermann Gro\u00ebr, who was removed from office in 1995. In 1998, Sch\u00f6nborn publicly confirmed that he believed in the allegations against Gro\u00ebr.[12] In 2010, he explained that the future Pope Benedict XVI had long pressed for a full investigation of the case, but met resistance in the Vatican at the time.[13]\n[edit] Views\nSch\u00f6nborn has been described as a \"conciliatory pragmatist who is open to dialogue.\"[14]\n[edit] Islam and Catholicism\nHe favours dialogue between Catholicism and Islam.[15]\n[edit] Catholic-Orthodox dialogue\nSch\u00f6nborn has said that theological differences between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches can be resolved, if the two faiths can overcome the burden of history.[16]\n[edit] HIV/AIDS and condoms\nIn 1996, Sch\u00f6nborn told an Austrian television audience that someone suffering from AIDS might use a condom as a \"lesser evil\", but he quickly cautioned, \"no one could affirm that the use of a condom is the ideal in sexual relations.\"[17]\n[edit] Mozart, Catholicism and Freemasonry\nAccording to Eric Leitenberger, Sch\u00f6nborn's spokesman, the cardinal's position is that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a Freemason, but that he was also fully Catholic.[18]\n[edit] Evolution and the Catholic Church\nIn an editorial in the New York Times on 7 July 2005[19] Sch\u00f6nborn accepted the possibility of evolution but criticised certain \"neo-Darwinian\" theories as incompatible with Catholic teaching:\n\nEvolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense \u2013 an unguided, unplanned process of random variation and natural selection \u2013 is not. Any system of thought that denies or seeks to explain away the overwhelming evidence for design in biology is ideology, not science.\n\nThis statement created considerable controversy, including public criticism of Sch\u00f6nborn's views by the director of the Vatican Observatory, George Coyne, SJ, who pointed out that Pope John Paul II\u2019s declaration that \u201cevolution is no longer a mere hypothesis\u201d is now \u201ca fundamental church teaching\u201d[20] and a response by Catholic physicist Stephen Barr in the Catholic periodical First Things,[21] to which Sch\u00f6nborn in turn replied.[22]\n[edit] Coat of arms\n\n\n\n\nChristoph Sch\u00f6nborn's coat of arms as a cardinal and archbishop.

He studied at the Seminary of Hageveld from 1945 to 1951, and at the Major Seminary of Warmond from 1951 to 1957. He was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Martien Jansen on 15 June 1957, and then did pastoral work in the Diocese of Rotterdam until 1959, serving as curate at the parish of Saint Victor in Waddinxveen and later at the parish Holy Martyrs Gorinchem in Rotterdam.\nFrom 1959 to 1966, he furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas and the Pontifical Biblical Institute, from where he obtained a doctorate cum laude in biblical exegesis with a thesis entitled: \"Jesus as the Good Shepherd in the Gospel of Saint John\". Following his return to the Netherlands, he served as pastor of the parish of Blessed Sacrament in The Hague (1966\u20131970) and chaplain in the Red Cross Hospital. He became a canon of the cathedral chapter of Rotterdam in March 1969.\nHe was named Bishop of Rotterdam on 29 December 1970. The appointment of a conservative priest as a bishop in the then progressive Catholic Church in the Netherlands caused a lot of turmoil, and Simonis had to devote himself to promoting harmony and unity in his community. Simonis became Archbishop of Utrecht on 3 December 1983. A former president of the Dutch Bishops' Conference, Simonis was a major supporter of the Pope John Paul II's eventful visit to the Netherlands in 1985.\nHe was elevated to the College of Cardinals during the Consistory of 25 May 1985, as Cardinal-Priest of Basilica of San Clemente, making him the seventh cardinal of the Dutch Church. He is a member of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, and of the Congregation for Catholic Education and the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. He will hold these memberships until his 80th birthday on 26 November 2011.\nCardinal Simonis was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nCardinal Simonis sent his letter of resignation as Archbishop of Utrecht to Pope Benedict on 13 November 2006, and the Pope accepted it on 14 April 2007, two months before Simonis celebrated his golden jubilee as a priest on 15 June. Simonis continued to govern the archdiocese as Apostolic Administrator until his successor, Wim Eijk, who was appointed on 11 December of the same year, took possession of the see.\n[edit] Controversy\nIn 2011 Cardinal Simonis testified on 25 January that he had no role in the appointment or dismissal of a Catholic priest accused of drugging and raping a young man. The brief appearance by Cardinal Simonis at Middelburg District Court marked the first time such a senior cleric had appeared in a Dutch courtroom to answer questions about abuse in the church. The victim, Dave ten Hoor, says he was drugged and raped twice by the priest, identified only as Father Jan N., in 1989 and 1990 in the southern town of Terneuzen. \"I do not know him at all,\" Simonis said of Father Jan, adding that he had nothing to do with his appointment as a priest in Terneuzen. Simonis has been drawn into the case because before moving to Terneuzen Father Jan also allegedly abused children at a youth centre run by the Salesian order in Rijswijk, a town just outside The Hague. At the time, Simonis was Bishop of Rotterdam and Rijswijk fell within his diocese. However Cardinal Simonis said he had visited the centre just once for a party and did not recall meeting the priest, though he did not rule out that he may have been introduced to him.[1]\nAccording to Radio Netherlands World:\n\n\"The cardinal was told by the then bishop of Rotterdam, Philippe B\u00e4r, that the priest had sexually abused underage boys in his parish in Zoetermeer. Bishop B\u00e4r wanted the priest out of his diocese. Archbishop Simonis then arranged for the man to be moved to a parish in Amersfoort.\n\n\nThe cardinal kept the Amersfoort parish in the dark about the priest\u2019s paedophile behaviour and convictions. The priest himself says the cardinal did nothing to monitor how the situation developed.\n\n\nParents who complained about the priest to Cardinal Simonis were given no assistance.

He lost his mother as a child and his family took refuge in Thuringia, due to the expulsions following the end of World War II; his homeland of Warmia is now within Poland.\n[edit] Priest and bishop\nSterzinsky was ordained a priest in 1960. After serving as a parish priest for fifteen years, he became Vicar General to the Bishop of Erfurt in 1981. In 1989, he himself was appointed Bishop of Berlin and, in 1994, while remaining at the See of Berlin, he was promoted to the position of Archbishop of Berlin.\n[edit] Cardinal\nSterzinsky was proclaimed Cardinal-Priest of S. Giuseppe all'Aurelio on 28 June 1991. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nPope Benedict XVI accepted Cardinal Sterzinsky's retirement as Metropolitan Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Berlin on 24 February 2011, for reasons of age (he had reached the age limit of 75, at which all bishops must write a letter to the Pope, offering to resign if the Pope wants).\nNo successor was immediately named for Cardinal Sterzinsky upon his retirement, so the Archdiocese of Berlin was a vacant see (sede vacante) at the time. On 2 July 2011, two days after the Cardinal's death, Pope Benedict XVI, named Rainer Maria Woelki as the new Metropolitan Archbishop of Berlin.\nIn April 2011 Cardinal Sterzinsky was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic. Since the Cardinal's resignation, Auxiliary Bishop Matthias Heinrich had been the apostolic administrator until the new Archbishop was named. In May 2011 it was reported that the condition of Cardinal Sterzinsky was very serious after he developed pneumonia and had to be brought from the rehabilitation centre back to the hospital. Cardinal Sterzinsky died on 30 June in the early morning. Pope Benedict XVI sent a telegram of condolence to Auxiliary Bishop Heinrich, expressing his closeness to the people of the Archdiocese and praising His Eminence's efforts in serving the people of Berlin during the fall of the Berlin Wall and the transition to a united Germany.\n[edit] Views\nIn November 2004, Sterzinsky criticized the notion of \"gay marriage\". He argued in a sermon that it could be necessary for Catholics to protest and resist gay marriage laws \"die dem Gesetz Gottes widersprechen\" (\"that are contradictory to the laws of God\").\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Berliner Erzbischof Sterzinsky gestorben\".

He spent his childhood in Z\u00e1lu\u017e\u00ed near Chy\u0161ky, where he attended elementary school and experienced the hard labour of farm work.\nAt the age of 11, he first started thinking about the priesthood. This initial idea of a priestly vocation came to him because he felt particularly challenged by a poster hanging in his parish church that continued to attract his attention. The poster said: 'Wouldn't you like to become a priest?'. That goal seemed unattainable at the time, so he dreamed of becoming an aircraft pilot.\nOn 20 June 1952 he passed his final examination at Secondary School in \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, Southern Bohemia. In those years of Communist persecution theological studies were impossible, so from 1952 to 1953 he worked at the Motor Union automobile factory in \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice and from 1953 to 1955 did military service in Karlovy Vary.\nDespite the political situation, after being discharged he was able to study archival science at the Arts Faculty of the Charles University in Prague and received his degree in 1960. He worked in various archives in Southern Bohemia: at the Regional Archives of T\u0159ebo\u0148 in Jind\u0159ich\u016fv Hradec, and from December 1960 to 1964 at the Civic and District Archives of \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, where he served as director.\nIn this same period he published a series of articles in various scientific reviews. In 1964 he left this work in order to study at the Theology Faculty of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Litom\u011b\u0159ice (1964\u20131968).\n[edit] Priesthood\nOn 23 June 1968, during the 'Prague Spring', he was ordained a priest at the age of 36 and was immediately appointed secretary to Bishop Josef Hlouch of \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice (1968\u20131971).\nThe state authorities, worried about his influence and pastoral activity, forced him in 1971 to leave \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice and sent him to the parishes of La\u017ei\u0161t\u011b and Z\u00e1blat\u00ed, isolated on the mountains of the Bohemian Forest in the Prachatice district. From 1 November 1972 he was parish priest in Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem and at the same time in Bohut\u00edn and Drahenice, in the P\u0159\u00edbram district. There in 1978, the state authorities, in collaboration with the local communists, revoked his state authorization to exercise his priestly ministry.\nCitizen Vlk was thus forced to live underground in Prague from October 1978 to 31 December 1988.\nFrom 1978 to 1986 he worked as a window-cleaner in downtown Prague. In this period he secretly carried out his pastoral activity with small groups of lay people. From 1986 to 1988 he was able to work in the district archives of the Czechoslovak State Bank in Prague.\nOn 1 January 1989, at the start of the 'turning point', he was permitted to exercise the priestly ministry for a 'trial' year. He became parish priest at \u017dihobce and Bukovn\u00edk in the Klatovy region of Western Bohemia. Subsequently, on 1 September 1989, he began to work as a curate on the Bavarian (German) border: at \u010cachrov, Javorn\u00e1, \u017delezn\u00e1 Ruda, B\u011b\u0161iny and Str\u00e1\u017e na \u0160umav\u011b.\n[edit] Bishop\nWith the so-called 'Velvet Revolution', the history of worker Miloslav Vlk suddenly changed. On 14 February 1990 Pope John Paul II appointed him Bishop of \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice and he received episcopal ordination on 31 March 1990 from Bishop Anton\u00edn Li\u0161ka.\nAfter a year at this post, on 27 March 1991 Pope John Paul II appointed Bishop Vlk as the Archbishop of Prague, successor to the late Cardinal Franti\u0161ek Tom\u00e1\u0161ek. The official installation took place on 1 June 1991. He was then created and proclaimed Cardinal by Pope John Paul II in the Consistory of 26 November 1994, becoming the Cardinal-Priest of the Titulus S. Crucis in Hierusalem.\n\n\nStyles of\nMiloslav Vlk\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nPrague (emeritus)\n\n\nIn 1992 he was elected President of the Czech Episcopal Conference; a role that he held until 2001. From 16 April 1993 until 31 May 2001 Archbishop Vlk was President of the Council of European Episcopal Conferences (CCEE), as the successor to Carlo Maria Martini, Archbishop of Milan, Italy. Special Secretary of the 1st Special Assembly for Europe of the Synod of Bishops (1991); and has taken part in the 9th General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops (1994) and in the 2nd Special Assembly for Europe (1999).\nBetween 1992 and 1993 he received three honorary degrees: one each from Illinois Benedictine College and the University of St. Thomas in the U.S., and a doctorate in theology from the Faculty of Passau. In addition to these academic awards he has also received various honorary citizenships.\nVlk was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. Vlk reached age 80 on May 17, 2012 and lost the right to participate in any papal conclave and on the same day he ceased to hold his various Curial memberships. He was a member of the following dicasteries of the Roman Curia:\n\nOriental Churches (congregation)\nSocial Communications (council)\nSpecial Council for Europe of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops\n\nThe Pope accepted Cardinal Vlk's retirement as Archbishop of Prague on 13 February 2010 and nominated Dominik Duka to succeed him.\nThe Cardinal had served for 18 years in the role of Moderator of the Bishop-Friends of the Focolare Movement. On Friday, August 10, 2012, he was succeeded in this position by Archbishop Francis Xavier Kriengsak Kovithavanij, the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bangkok in Bangkok, Thailand.[1]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Church properties in the Czech Republic\nVlk has fought a decade-long battle to work out a new legal framework for the Catholic Church in the Czech Republic, which would include resolution of some $6 billion in church property confiscated under the Communists and never returned. That includes almost a million acres (4,000 km\u00b2) of forest which formed the church's traditional economic base.[2]\n[edit] Political groups\nVlk has been sharply critical of the rise of far-right and xenophobic sentiment in Central Europe, joining Jewish protests in 2007 when right-wingers planned a march through Prague's Jewish quarter on the anniversary of Kristallnacht.[2]\nOn the 41st anniversary of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, Cardinal Vlk called for the ban of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, which is currently the third most popular political party in the Czech Republic according to opinion polls.[3]\n[edit] Relationship with traditionalists\nIn 2006, Vlk criticized a group of Lefebvrite tradionalists who held a conference in Prague, accusing them of sympathies for \"anti-Semitism and neo-Nazism.\" Local organizers fired back that Vlk showed \"ill will to socially ostracize Catholics who point to the negative consequences of liberalization processes in the church.\"[2]\n[edit] References\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructs such as ibid., loc. cit. and idem are discouraged by Wikipedia's style guide for footnotes, as they are easily broken.

He taught exegesis at the Toronto School of Theology from 1970 to 1976, when he was named Auxiliary Bishop of Toronto on 27 May of that year. On 22 May 1986 he became Coadjutor Archbishop of Toronto, and duly succeeded to the position of Archbishop of Toronto on 17 March 1990.[3][4]\nIn 1998 he was created cardinal by Pope John Paul II and assigned the titular church of Santi Marcellino e Pietro. He became a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants in 1990, the Congregation for the Clergy in 1991, the Pontifical Council for Culture in 1993, and the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in 1999. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. He retired on 16 December 2006.[3][4]\nDuring his archiepiscopate, Toronto hosted World Youth Day in 2002. He was a vocal opponent of same-sex marriage in Canada. On his retirement for reasons of age, Ambro\u017ei\u010d was succeeded as archbishop of Toronto by Thomas Christopher Collins on 30 January 2007.\nCardinal Ambrozic died on 26 August 2011 after a lengthy illness.[5] His funeral mass was held on 31 August 2011 at Saint Michael's Cathedral in Toronto, with Archbishop Thomas Collins presiding. More than 1000 people attended the mass, including Federal Finance Minister James Flaherty and Mayors Robert Ford and Hazel McCallion.\n[edit] Views\nAmbro\u017ei\u010d was a somewhat contentious figure in Canadian Catholicism, and the subject of vocal opposition from some liberal or progressive Catholics and ex-Catholics for his conservative stands.[citation needed] At the same time, he rejected a request from the Toronto Traditional Mass Society (the local chapter of Una Voce) to invite the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter to offer Tridentine Masses in the archdiocese [1].\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ http://www.archtoronto.org/CardinalAmbrozic/index.htm\n^ http://www.archtoronto.org/CardinalAmbrozic/index.htm\n^ a b c d Catholic Register articles\n^ a b c Biography of Cardinal Ambro\u017ei\u010d\n^ \"Catholic Community Mourns the Loss of Cardinal Aloysius Ambrozic\". http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/402646.\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nCardinal Ambrozic from the Archdiocese of Toronto\nCardinal Ambrozic on catholic-pages.com\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nGerald Emmett Carter\nArchbishop of Toronto\n17 March 1990 \u2013 16 December 2006\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nThomas Christopher Collins\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nAmbrozic, Aloysius\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\nJanuary 27, 1930\n\n\nPlace of birth\nGaberje, Slovenia\n\n\nDate of death\nAugust 26, 2011\n\n\nPlace of death\nToronto, Ontario, Canada\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 7354/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 40640/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 35142/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 11475/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 21/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1680822-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130225170214 ", "Name": "Aloysius Ambrozic"}, {"url": "/wiki/Edward_Egan", "FullText": "For the police officer, see Eddie Egan.\n\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Edward Michael Egan\n\n\nCardinal-Archbishop Emeritus of New York\n\n\n\n\n\nSee\nNew York (Emeritus)\n\n\nAppointed\nMay 11, 2000\n\n\nEnthroned\nJune 19, 2000\n\n\nReign ended\nFebruary 23, 2009\n\n\nPredecessor\nJohn Joseph O'Connor\n\n\nSuccessor\nTimothy Michael Dolan\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of Ss.

He was elevated to the cardinalate in 2001.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Priesthood\n3 Episcopal career\n\n3.1 Bishop of Bridgeport\n3.2 Archbishop of New York\n\n\n4 Later years\n5 Views and controversies\n\n5.1 Abortion\n5.2 Gay marriage\n5.3 Abuse affairs in Bridgeport\n5.4 Clerical celibacy\n\n\n6 References\n7 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and education\nThe third of four children, Edward Egan was born in Oak Park, Illinois, to Thomas and Genevieve (n\u00e9e Costello) Egan. His father was a sales manager and his mother was a homemaker and former teacher; his parents' families were from County Mayo and County Clare, Ireland. In 1943, Egan and his older brother contracted polio, causing them to miss two years of school while convalescing at home.\nHe graduated from Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary, where he had been student body president and editor of the student newspaper and yearbook, in 1951. Egan then entered St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, from where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy. He was then sent to continue his formation for the priesthood at the Pontifical North American College in Rome, taking his academic courses in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.\n[edit] Priesthood\nEgan was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Martin John O'Connor on December 15, 1957, and earned a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Gregorian in 1958. Upon his return to the United States, he served as curate of Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago, assistant chancellor for the Archdiocese, and secretary to Cardinal Albert Gregory Meyer until 1960. During this time, he also taught evening classes for potential Catholic converts and served as a chaplain at Wesley Memorial Hospital.\nIn 1960, Egan returned to the Gregorian in Rome to pursue his doctoral studies. During his studies, he became assistant vice-rector and repetitor of moral theology and canon law at the Pontifical North American College. He received his doctorate in canon law summa cum laude in 1964. Egan, returning to the Archdiocese of Chicago, became secretary to John Cardinal Cody. As his secretary, he \"saw Cardinal Cody take the heat for good causes\" such as civil rights and desegregation.\nEgan was later appointed Secretary of the Archdiocesan Commissions on Ecumenism and Human Relations, sitting on several interfaith organizations and establishing dialogue with Jews and Protestants alike. From 1969 to 1971, he served as co-chancellor for the Archdiocese. Egan once again returned to Rome in 1971, when Pope Paul VI named him an auditor of the Sacred Roman Rota. While serving on the Roman Rota, he was also a professor of canon law at the Gregorian and of civil and criminal procedure at the Studio Rotale. Egan served as a commissioner of the Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship and a consultor of the Congregation for the Clergy as well. In 1982, he was chosen to be one of the six canonists who reviewed the new Code of Canon Law with Pope John Paul II before its promulgation in 1983.\n[edit] Episcopal career\nOn April 1, 1985, Egan was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of Allegheny by John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following May 22 from Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, with Archbishop John Joseph O'Connor and Bishop John Richard Keating serving as co-consecrators, in Rome. He selected as his episcopal motto: \"In the Holiness of the Truth\" (Ephesians 4:24). As an auxiliary, he served as Vicar for Education in the Archdiocese from 1985 to 1988.\n[edit] Bishop of Bridgeport\nEgan was later named the third Bishop of Bridgeport, Connecticut, on November 5, 1988. He was formally installed on December 14 of that year.\nDuring his tenure, he oversaw the reorganization of Catholic schools. He also raised $45 million for diocesan schools through a fundraising campaign, \"Faith in the Future.\" The diocesan Catholic Charities under his tenure became the largest private social service agency in Fairfield County. With regard to the 12 Hispanic parishes in the diocese, he brought Spanish priests to Bridgeport from Colombia. He also established a home for retired priests and a school for children with special needs.\nWithin the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, he served as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Pontifical North American College and of the Committee on Science and Human Values. He was also a member of the Committee on Canonical Affairs, the Committee on Education, the Committee on National Collections, and the Committee on Nominations, and served two terms on the Conference's Administrative Board.\n[edit] Archbishop of New York\nEgan was appointed Archbishop of New York on May 11, 2000 and installed in that position on June 19, 2000. Soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming sang at the ceremony.[1]\nOn becoming archbishop of New York, Egan made it a priority to encourage vocations to the priesthood. Besides private initiatives, each year on the Feast of St. Joseph (March 19) he offered a Mass to which high school and college men attracted to the priestly vocation were invited. He appointed two priests as vocation directors to aid him in promoting the vocation to the priesthood.\nHe was elevated to the Cardinalate by Pope John Paul II at the Consistory of February 21, 2001 becoming the Cardinal-Priest of Ss. Ioannis et Pauli (Sts. John and Paul). This was the same title held by all of the archbishops of New York since Cardinal Francis Spellman in 1946 was given the title by Pope Pius XII, who had held it himself when he was Cardinal Pacelli.\nA main concern of the Cardinal was the archdiocesan seminary in Yonkers, New York. In March 2001, he announced his decision to restructure the seminary faculty. A Staten Island pastor, Monsignor Peter Finn was chosen as seminary rector. Among others, the Cardinal added Avery Dulles, S.J., Sister Sara Butler, M.S.B.T., and Father John Augustine DiNoia, O.P. (before he was called to Rome to be undersecretary for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2002) to the faculty. The minor seminary, then in Riverdale, New York was moved to the campus of the major seminary. To maintain regular contact with the seminarians, Egan invited the seminarians to serve his 10:15 am Mass at Saint Patrick's Cathedral on one Sunday each month, and afterward would meet with them in his residence. Moreover, each year, he himself conducted a day of prayer and reflection for the seminary students and faculty.\nFor retired the priests of the archdiocese, Egan established the John Cardinal O'Connor residence in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. In 2002 the \"Instituci\u00f3n del M\u00e9rito Humanitario\" with its seat in Barcelona (Spain) awarded him with the \"Gran Cruz al M\u00e9rito Humanitario\". In 2002 Pope John Paul II named Egan, along with five other cardinals, to the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signature, the Church's highest court in matters of Canon Law.\nIn June 2003, Egan was accused of concealing the names of priests who have been accused of child molestation and found not guilty by the Church. His spokesman argued that the innocent should be protected, while groups such as Voice of the Faithful criticized the process as being out of the public view.\nEgan was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nIn December 2006, Egan began hosting a weekly program on The Catholic Channel of Sirius Satellite Radio in which he discussed a variety of topics, including events in the Archdiocese and issues in the Church. The station launched by the Cardinal's initiative also broadcasts his Sunday Mass from the Cathedral. At other times scheduled programs include news, human-interest stories and inspirational themes, reflections on Scripture, Catholic education, social ministry, sacred music, interviews, call-in, and spiritual guidance.[2]\nEgan, after more than a year of careful study and consultation, announced on January 19, 2007 that ten parishes of the Archdiocese would be canonically suppressed and eleven would be merged with other parishes. At the same time he made known that he had decided not to close or merge nine parishes and six missions originally recommended either for closing or merger. Moreover, five new parishes would be established, three in Orange County, and one each in Staten Island and Dutchess County due to population increases. Building projects were also approved for nine parishes.[3] The closures caused some discontent.[4]\n[edit] Later years\nEgan, in keeping with the Code of Canon Law, offered his resignation as archbishop of New York to Pope Benedict XVI on April 2, 2007, when he reached 75 years of age. His resignation became official on February 23, 2009 when Pope Benedict XVI appointed Archbishop Timothy Dolan as his successor, who took possession of the archdiocese on April 15, 2009. Egan is the first Archbishop of New York to retire; all previous Archbishops of New York died in office, even after the introduction of the requirement for bishops to offer their resignation from their positions of pastoral care upon reaching age 75.\nOn December 15, 2007, Egan celebrated his 50th anniversary as a priest. He was appointed by the pope to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches on January 26, 2008. In January 2009, he publicly condemned the controversial statements made by Society of Saint Pius X Bishop Richard Williamson.[5]\nHe is a member of the Board of Trustees at the Catholic University of America and a member of the Board of Governors at Ave Maria School of Law. He reached age 80 on April 2, 2012, and from then on he would be able to participate in discussions prior to conclave voting, but not enter a conclave.\nEgan was admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital on April 4, 2009, after experiencing stomach pains.[6][7] After undergoing various tests, he was released from the hospital on April 7, and was later given a pacemaker in a low-risk surgery.[8][9][10] He was well enough to preside over the following liturgical services for Holy Week.[8]\nIn addition to his native English, he speaks French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish.\n[edit] Views and controversies\n[edit] Abortion\nIn a strongly worded article published next to a photo of an unborn baby in the womb, Cardinal Edward Egan compared tolerating abortions to the reasoning used by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin to commit mass murders.[11] With regard to self-professed Catholic politicians who support abortion, Egan adhered to the Church's discipline of forbidding Holy Communion to such persons due to the public scandal. In April 2008, after newspapers had published photographs of former Mayor of New York Rudolph Giuliani receiving Communion at a Mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral offered by Pope Benedict XVI, Egan issued a public statement:\n\nThe Catholic Church clearly teaches that abortion is a grave offense against the will of God. Throughout my years as Archbishop of New York, I have repeated this teaching in sermons, articles, addresses, and interviews without hesitation or compromise of any kind. Thus it was that I had an understanding with Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, when I became Archbishop of New York and he was serving as Mayor of New York, that he was not to receive the Eucharist because of his well-known support of abortion. I deeply regret that Mr. Giuliani received the Eucharist during the Papal visit here in New York, and I will be seeking a meeting with him to insist that he abide by our understanding.[12]\n\n[edit] Gay marriage\nCardinal Edward Egan assailed the notion of gay marriage and criticized Hollywood for \"desecrating\" marriage and destroying \"something sacred and holy.\" Egan said the specter of legal same-sex marriage would have a devastating effect on traditional values already eroded by a crude pop culture, the Daily News reported.[13]\n[edit] Abuse affairs in Bridgeport\nThe Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in May 2009 that records detailing sexual abuse allegations by priests in the Diocese of Bridgeport should be released, a case that may provide an embarrassing footnote to the career of recently retired New York Cardinal Edward Egan. The court's 4-1 ruling covers more than 12,600 pages of documents from 23 lawsuits against six priests that have been under seal since the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport settled the cases in 2001 (cf Sexual abuse scandal in Bridgeport diocese).[14]\nIn April 2002, in a letter read out at Mass, Egan apologized saying,\"If in hindsight we also discover that mistakes may have been made as regards prompt removal of priests and assistance to victims, I am deeply sorry.\"[15] Ten years later, in February 2012, the retired cardinal retracted his apology. In an interview with Connecticut magazine he said, I never should have said that,\u201d and, \u201cI don\u2019t think we did anything wrong.\u201d He repeatedly denied any sexual abuse happened while he was leading Bridgeport diocese.[16][17]\n[edit] Clerical celibacy\nIn a radio interview given on March 10, 2009, Egan stated that clerical celibacy in the Latin Rite could be open to discussion.[18][19] He added, \"I think it has to be looked at, and I'm not so sure it wouldn't be a good idea to decide on the basis of geography and culture\u2014not to make an across-the-board determination.\" He further noted that Eastern Rite priests are allowed to marry, \"no problem at all.\" Egan later moderated his statement, saying, \"Celibacy is one of the Church's greatest blessings. I will have to be more careful about trying to explain a somewhat complicated matter in 90 seconds.\"[20]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Barron, James; Nemy, Enid (June 16, 2000). \"Public Lives\".

(n\u00e9e McCarthy) George.[3] He has an older sister, Margaret.[4] He received his early education at the parochial school of St. Pascal Church in Chicago's Northwest Side.[5]\nGeorge contracted polio at age 13.[6] Due to his disability, he was rejected by Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary, and instead enrolled at St. Henry Preparatory Seminary in Belleville, a high school seminary of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate.[7] He joined the Missionary Oblates on August 14, 1957.[3] He continued his studies at the Oblates novitiate in Godfrey before entering Our Lady of the Snows Seminary in Pass Christian, Mississippi.[5]\nGeorge was then sent to study theology at the University of Ottawa in Canada.[2] He made his solemn vows as a member of the Missionary Oblates on September 8, 1961.[5]\n[edit] Priesthood\nOn December 21, 1963, George was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Raymond Hillinger at his home parish of St. Pascal Church.[1] He received a Bachelor of Theology degree from the University of Ottawa in 1964, followed by a Master of Arts degree in Philosophy from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. in 1965.[2] He then taught philosophy at Our Lady of the Snows Seminary in Pass Christian (1964\u201369), Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana (1968), and Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska (1969\u20131973).[3]\nDuring his teaching assignments, George earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in American Philosophy from Tulane University in 1970, and a Master of Theology degree from the University of Ottawa in 1971.[4] He served as provincial superior of the Midwestern Province for the Missionary Oblates in Saint Paul, Minnesota, from 1973 until 1974, when he became vicar general of his religious order.[5] Based in Rome, he served as vicar general for 12 years. He obtained a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree from the Pontifical Urbaniana University in 1988, with a thesis entitled: \"Inculturation and communion\".[2]\nGeorge returned to the United States, where he served as coordinator of the Circle of Fellows at the Center for the Study of Faith and Culture in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1987\u201390).[4]\n[edit] Early episcopacy\nOn July 10, 1990, George was appointed the fifth Bishop of Yakima in Washington by Pope John Paul II.[1] He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 21 from Archbishop Agostino Cacciavillan, with Bishops Roger Schwietz, OMI, and William S. Skylstad serving as co-consecrators, at Holy Family Church in Yakima.[1] He took as his episcopal motto: Christo Gloria in Ecclesia (Latin: \"To Christ be Glory in the Church\").[8]\nGeorge served the Diocese of Yakima for five and a half years. As a member of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), he served as chair of the Commission for Bishops and Scholars (1992\u20131994), and as a consultant to the Committees on Evangelization (1991\u201393), Hispanic Affairs (1994\u201397), and Science and Values (1994\u201397).[3] He was episcopal advisor to the Cursillo Movement (Region XII) from 1990 to 1997, and episcopal moderator of the National Catholic Office for Persons with Disabilities from 1990 to 2008. He was a papal appointee to the 1994 World Synod of Bishops on Consecrated Life, and attended the Ninth Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Vatican City in October 1994.[2]\nOn April 30, 1996, George was appointed the ninth Archbishop of Portland in Oregon.[1] He was installed on the following May 27 at St. Mary's Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. During his brief tenure, he led the Archdiocese's response to a tape recording by the Lane County jail of an inmate's sacramental confession; the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later ruled that the tape recording was an unconstitutional and illegal act.[5]\n[edit] Archbishop of Chicago\n\n\nStyles of\nFrancis George\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nChicago\n\n\nLess than a year later, on April 8, 1997, Pope John Paul II appointed Archbishop George the eighth Archbishop of Chicago to fill a vacancy left by the death of Cardinal Joseph Bernardin on November 14, 1996. He was the first native Chicagoan to assume the office. On May 7 after his appointment, the Apostolic Pro-Nuncio Agostino Cacciavillan installed Archbishop George as Archbishop of Chicago in Holy Name Cathedral.\nOn January 18, 1998, Pope John Paul II announced Archbishop George's elevation to the Sacred College of Cardinals with the title of Cardinal-Priest of San Bartolomeo all'Isola. Newly named Cardinal George was awarded the privileges of the scarlet vestments and biretta in consistory at the Vatican on February 21.\nGeorge was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. He will be eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves that occur before January 16, 2017 when he will reach his 80th birthday.\nAt the conclave, he, like Cardinal Rigali of Philadelphia, was known as a conservative supporter of Benedict, saying afterward in a press conference, \"It was a choice that was apparent almost immediately.\"\nCardinal George publishes a locally well-read column bi-monthly in the Chicago archdiocesan newspaper of which he is Publisher, The Catholic New World, called \"The Cardinal's Column\". He is also the Publisher of the Archdiocese of Chicago's Hispanic and Polish newspapers, respectively Chicago Cat\u00f3lico and Katolik.\nHe has published at least two pastoral letters. The first, \"Becoming An Evangelizing People\", was released on November 21, 1997. The second was a major discourse on the sinful and destructive nature of racism, Dwell in My Love, released on April 4, 2001.\nThe Cardinal is the author of two locally well-known books. The first, The Difference God Makes: A Catholic Vision of Faith, Communion, and Culture, was published in October 2009 by Crossroad Publishing Company. It is a collection of essays exploring our relationship with God, the responsibility of communion and the transformation of culture. His most recent book, God in Action: How Faith in God Can Address the Challenges of the World, was published in May 2011 by Doubleday Religion. In this collection of essays, he reflects on the significance of religious faith in the public sphere and underscores the unique contributions of religion to the common good.\nAs Cardinal Bernardin referred to himself as \"Joseph your brother\", George refers to himself as \"Francis your neighbor\".\nGeorge is also known for continuing the work of his predecessor Cardinal Bernardin, regarding young people in the church \u2013 specifically, by addressing the archdiocese's annual Theology on Tap gathering in 1997. In his invitation to the event, he wrote, \u201cYou are very important members of the Church. Your energy, talent and faith will give me much help as together we build up our local Church to be a vital presence in the Chicago area. Together we can continue the mission of Jesus Christ to bring the Gospel of love, forgiveness and holiness to all the places where we live and encounter others.\u201d\n[edit] Interfaith relations\nIn 2007, he asked Jews to reconsider descriptions of Jesus in the Talmud as a \"bastard\" in exchange for a softening of traditional Catholic prayers calling for Jews to be converted to Christianity.[9] In 2009, he condemned negationist declarations made by bishop Richard Williamson, a member of the Society of Saint Pius X.[10]\nIn 2010, he spoke at Brigham Young University about the continued need for Catholics and Mormons to stand together to protect religious freedom. \"In recent years, Catholics and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have stood more frequently side by side in the public square to defend human life and dignity,\" Cardinal George said. He also praised the LDS Church for its efforts alongside the Catholic Church to combat poverty and pornography and the need to define marriage as between one man and one woman.[11]\nLater in 2010, he further outlined the degree to which he believed religious freedoms (in the United States and other Western societies) was endangered. In a speech to a group of priests, he said, \"I expect to die in bed, my successor will die in prison and his successor will die a martyr in the public square. His successor will pick up the shards of a ruined society and slowly help rebuild civilization, as the church has done so often in human history.\"[12] Originally published online without the second sentence,[13] this statement has widely been interpreted as reactionary by liberal members of the American political left and accurate by conservative members of the American political right.\n[edit] Extra-diocesan posts\nPope John Paul II appointed Cardinal George to several offices of the Roman Curia:\n\nCongregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments\nCongregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life\nCongregation for the Evangelization of Peoples\nPontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church\nCongregation for Oriental Churches\nPontifical Council for Culture\nPontifical Council Cor Unum\n\nIn 2010, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him to the Pontifical Council for the Study of the Organizational and Economic Problems of the Holy See.\nHe was appointed by Pope John Paul II to the 1994 World Synod of Bishops on Consecrated Life and a delegate and one of two special secretaries at the Synod of Bishops for America in 1997. He was a delegate of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to the 2001 World Synod of Bishops, and was also elected to the Council for the World Synod of Bishops in 2001. He served as a delegate of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for the 2008 World Synod of Bishops on \"The Word of God in the Life and Mission of the Church.\nHe served as Vice President (2004\u20132007) and President (2007\u20132010) of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. He is a member of its Committee on Divine Worship and its Ad Hoc Committee on Shrines. He also serves as a consultant to the Committee on Doctrine and Pro-Life Activities and the Subcommittee on Lay Ministry.\nHe has also served on Conference of Bishops Committees on Doctrine, on Latin America, on Missions, on Religious Life, the American Board of Catholic Missions, and on World Missions; on the Ad Hoc Committee to Oversee the Use of the Catechism and the Subcommittee on Campus Ministry.\nHe was Chair of the Committee for Bishops and Scholars from 1992\u20131994, and of the Committee on Liturgy from 2001\u20132004, and a consultant to the Committees on Evangelization (1991\u20131993), Hispanic Affairs (1994\u20131997), Science and Values (1994\u20131997), and African American Catholics (1999\u20132002). He was the Representative to the International Commission on English and the Liturgy from 1997\u20132006.\nBecause of his position as Cardinal Archbishop of Chicago, since 1997, when he assumed the office, he has been the de facto Chancellor of the University of St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary (the Archdiocesan Seminary in the suburb of Mundelein, Illinois; both the seminary and the town are named after Cardinal George Mundelein, a deceased former Archbishop of Chicago).\nHe is the Chancellor, since 1997, of the Catholic Church Extension Society. He is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Washington, D.C.-based Catholic University of America since 1993. From 1997, he has been a Trustee of the Papal Foundation. In 1994, he became a member of the Board of Directors of the National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Since 1997, he has been a member of the Board of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.\nHe has been the Episcopal Liaison to the Catholic Campus Ministry Association Executive Board since 1998 and is now also the Episcopal Moderator for the Ministry of Transportation Chaplains, serving since 2003. He also served as Episcopal Advisor to the Cursillo Movement, Region XII, from 1990 to 1997.\nFrom 1990 to 2008, he was Episcopal Moderator and member of the board of the National Catholic Office for Persons with Disabilities (now known as the National Catholic Partnership on Disability). He brought personal experience to his role after a five-month bout with poliomyelitis at age 13 left him with permanent damage to his legs.\nCardinal George is Conventual Chaplain ad honorem of the Federal Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Grand Prior of the North Central Lieutenancy of the United States for the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, and a member of the Kohl McCormick Early Childhood Teaching Awards Advisory Board. He has been a member of the Board of Directors of Oblate Media, Belleville, Illinois, since 1988.\nHe is a member of the American Catholic Philosophical Association, the American Society of Missiologists, and the Catholic Commission on Intellectual and Cultural Affairs.\n[edit] Recent events and speculation on retirement and succession\nCardinal George had been mentioned as potential candidate to succeed Pope John Paul II according to TIME magazine[citation needed], and later to succeed Pope Benedict XVI as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. However, Benedict appointed former Archbishop of San Francisco William Levada to fill that office. He is a member of the board of trustees of the Catholic University of America, the Chancellor of Mundelein Seminary and Loyola University Chicago, and a member of the Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre. In May 2008, Father Robert Barron, a priest of the Archdiocese of Chicago, was named the first holder of the endowed Francis Cardinal George Chair of Systematic Theology at Mundelein Seminary, the second such named endowed chair the university started.\nIn March 2009 Cardinal George met with newly elected United States President Barack Obama.[14] In the fall of 2010, he finished his three-year presidency of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; he was succeeded by Archbishop Dolan of New York. Cardinal George turned 74 in January 2011, and as bishops are required to make an offer to the Pope to resign at age 75 (which may be deferred by the Pope until later), speculation is already beginning over who could succeed him given that George has had cancer, has fallen, and suffers from the after effects of childhood polio. However, he remains in relatively good shape considering those matters. He remains eligible to vote in future Papal conclaves until his 80th birthday in 2017.\nIn July 2011, Cardinal George was chosen to be one of eight U.S. Bishops- selected by the Roman Curia's Pontifical Council for the Laity, the Vatican body that convenes the event- to serve as catechists at the August 2011 World Youth Day celebration in Madrid, Spain.\nOn January 16, 2012, Cardinal George turned 75 and formally submitted his resignation to Pope Benedict XVI. The Cardinal noted he is a rarity among Chicago's bishops for having lived to see the possibility of retirement. He named the Very Reverend Father Peter F. \u015anieg, until then the Rector of St. Joseph's Seminary at Loyola University Chicago, as the Moderator of the Curia for the Archdiocese. Jimmy M. Lago remains as Chancellor. He has served for 12 years as Archdiocesan Chancellor. \u015anieg will report to the Cardinal. He appointed the Reverend Father Paul C. Stein, until then pastor of Chicago's St. Sylvester Parish, as Father \u015anieg's successor as Rector. The Cardinal anticipates remaining in office for about another two or three years so he can ensure a smooth transition, resolve certain issues and finish some current projects.[15]\n[edit] Comments on homosexuality\nA proposed change in route and start time for the 2012 annual Chicago Pride Parade (which would pass by a Catholic church on the new route) drew pointed criticism from Cardinal George. In a discussion with a Chicago Fox News Affiliate, the Cardinal said \"you don\u2019t want the Gay Liberation Movement to morph into something like the Ku Klux Klan.\"[16] In response, LGBT advocates in Chicago have called for the Cardinal's resignation.[17] The growing outcry resulted in the Cardinal's apology \"for the hurt\" his remarks seemed to have caused; the Cardinal's motivation for the remarks was a growing concern that the federal and state governments were impinging on the rights of Catholics by forcing them to abide by policies, enacted into law recently, which practicing Catholics who follow the Church's example would find questionable or objectionable. The Cardinal implied in his statements that he had either family members or close friends who had dealt either with being gay or lesbian or having family members who were.;[18] debate remains in the LGBT community as to whether this apology is sufficient.[19]\nLater, on New Year's Day, Tuesday, January 1, 2013, in an official pastoral letter to the priests and people of the Archdiocese that also served as his column in that issue of the The Catholic New World archdiocesan newspaper (co-signed by the incumbent Auxiliary Bishops of the Chicago Archdiocese and also appearing on the website of the Catholic Conference of Illinois), Cardinal George stated that the (likely imminent) passage of a same-sex marriage law in the state would be \"acting against the common good of society. This proposed legislation will have long-term consequences because laws teach; they tell us what is socially acceptable and what is not, and most people conform to the dictates of their respective society, at least in the short run\".[20]\n[edit] Second finding of cancer\nIn August 2012, Cardinal George underwent routine tests at the Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center at Loyola University Medical Center, in Maywood, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago- the institution where he had been treated six years prior in 2006 for bladder cancer in a multi-hour operation in which the bladder (cystectomy) and prostate (prostatectomy) had been removed, and doctors had eventually thought that the cancer had gone into full remission, the Cardinal having passed both the three- and five- year survival anniversaries that are traditionally used as benchmarks. He had been the only Archbishop of Chicago to be able to live to age 75 and submit his retirement while healthy- his predecessor and the Center's namesake, Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, had himself died in November 1996 of recurrent, metastatic pancreatic cancer. Most believed George to be relatively healthy. However, on Monday, August 20, 2012, the Archdiocese released a statement to the media and the public on its homepage, saying, in part, that the disease had somehow returned:\n\"As announced on Friday, August 17, Cardinal George learned from his doctors that test results from a procedure earlier in the week showed there were cancerous cells in his kidney and in a nodule that was removed from his liver. The Cardinal rested at home this weekend ... This week he will continue additional testing ...\"[21]\nThe above statement was updated later on Tuesday, August 28, 2012, which stated that, after his doctors at Loyola had consulted with his Rochester, Minnesota-based Mayo Clinic doctors, and after confirming the two cancerous areas, a course of attempted chemotherapy involving multiple sessions had been agreed upon, which would seem to suggest that an attempt will be made to fight the cancer again despite its presence in two vital organs.[21] Officials of the Archdiocese have requested that parishioners recite the Tolton Prayer while praying for his health as he begins chemotherapy in September 2012. The prayer is named after the locally well-known Father Augustus Tolton, a black African-American priest of the Archdiocese whose Cause for Canonization (Sainthood) is being promoted by the Archdiocese.\nBecause of the recurrence of his cancer, though it is not yet a pressing issue, Cardinal George may eventually ask for permission from Pope Benedict XVI to retire earlier than the two years he had originally planned. Some have speculated that he will ask for a coadjutor archbishop, a type of auxiliary bishop who would serve as one of his vicar generals and who would automatically succeed him when he retires or dies.\nThe Cardinal, after celebrating Mass (with little help from aides) for the First Sunday of Advent on Sunday, December 2, 2012, at Chicago's Queen of All Saints Basilica, told Chicago Tribune reporters he was feeling relatively well, even if he was very tired some days, and was expecting at the time to finish his current rounds of chemotherapy in January 2013 (one woman remarked his color was very good and Cardinal George was overheard telling a man they should have lunch sometime after Christmas). This suggests that, so far, at least, he is holding his own in his second bout with cancer.[22]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c d e Cheney, David. \"Francis Eugene Cardinal George, O.M.I.\".

Shortly afterward, the family moved to Lebanon, Pennsylvania where Keeler attended St. Mary School and Lebanon Catholic High School.[2] He was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout.\nKeeler received a BA from St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, in 1952. While studying at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, he was ordained to the priesthood on July 17, 1955 by Archbishop Luigi Traglia.\nHe received both a Licentiate of Sacred Theology (1956) and Doctorate of Canon Law (1961) from the Gregorian, and after doing pastoral and curial work in the Diocese of Harrisburg, he served as a peritus, or expert, and secretary to Bishop George Leech at the Second Vatican Council (1962\u20131965).\nKeeler was raised to the rank of Chaplain of His Holiness on November 9, 1965, and later Honorary Prelate of His Holiness on May 8, 1970.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn July 24, 1979, Keeler was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Harrisburg and Titular Bishop of Ulcinium. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 21 from Bishop Joseph Daley, with Bishops Francis Gossman and Martin Lohmuller serving as co-consecrators. Keeler took as his episcopal motto: Opus Fac Evangeliste (\"Do the Work of an Evangelist\"). He was named the seventh Bishop of Harrisburg on November 10, 1983, and then the fourteenth Metropolitan Archbishop of Baltimore on April 11, 1989. As Archbishop of Baltimore, Keeler was head of America's oldest see and de facto Primate.\nHe was elected President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in November 1992. He had been elected as the organization's Vice President in November 1989, when hosting Baltimore's bicentennial celebration of the founding of the diocese. He also serves as Chairman of the Maryland Catholic Conference, Chair of the Board and Chancellor of St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore, as well as of Mount Saint Mary's University.\nWhile president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Archbishop Keeler chaired the 1993 World Youth Day held in Denver, Colorado.\nKeeler developed a reputation for effectively building interfaith bonds, particularly for furthering Catholic-Jewish dialogue and serves as moderator of Catholic-Jewish Relations for the USCCB. As Chair of the U.S. Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs from 1984 to 1987, he helped arrange the Pope's meetings with Jewish leaders in Miami and with Protestant leaders in Columbia, South Carolina.\n[edit] Cardinal\nKeeler was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of November 26, 1994. He was appointed to the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity in the summer of 1994 and to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches in November 1994. From 1998 to 2001 and again since November 2003, he has served as Chair for the Committee on Pro-Life Activities. Keeler was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave. Cardinal Keeler reached age 80 on March 4, 2011, and lost the eligibility to participate in any future papal conclaves.\n\n\nStyles of\nWilliam Henry Keeler\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nBaltimore (emeritus)\n\n\nOne of Keeler's priorities was the strengthening of the Catholic school system. In 1992, he initiated the Lenten Appeal, a giving campaign that has raised over $44 million in support of Baltimore's Catholic schools, the needs of the less fortunate, and a variety of spiritual development efforts and the Cardinal's Partners in Excellence scholarship program has raised $16 million in tuition assistance for at-risk children.\nThe Cardinal was also responsible for the effort to restore Baltimore's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, America's first cathedral, the cost of which was financed entirely through private donations.\nKeeler is the President of the American Division Catholic Near East Welfare Association and Chair of the Black and Native American Missions Board. He is Chairman of the Board of Catholic Charities, the largest non-governmental agency providing assistance to the needy of Maryland. He is president of the Cathedral Foundation and publisher of The Catholic Review.\n[edit] Honors and awards\nAn Eagle Scout, Keeler is a recipient of the Silver Beaver, Silver Antelope, and Distinguished Eagle Scout Award of the Boy Scouts of America.[3]\nHe holds honorary degrees from Lebanon Valley College, Gettysburg College, Susquehanna University, and Gannon University.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Embryonic stem cell research\nAs chairman of the U.S. Bishops' Committee for Pro-life Activities, he criticized Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist's announcement that he will support federally funded stem cell research that requires destroying human embryos.[4]\n[edit] Ecumenism\nAt the annual general assembly of the National Council of Churches, he reassured delegates that the Roman Catholic Church, and the Pope, were firmly ecumenical.[5]\n[edit] Terri Schiavo\nCardinal Keeler mourned the death of Terri Schiavo, who had died after a controversial legal battle over the right for her relatives to remove her feeding tube.[6]\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nJoseph Thomas Daley\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nGordon Dunlap Bennett\nMarch 3, 1998\n\n\nWilliam Francis Malooly\nMarch 1, 2001\n\n\nMitchell Thomas Rozanski\nAugust 21, 2004\n\n\nMichael Joseph Bransfield\nFebruary 22, 2005\n\n\nDenis James Madden\nAugust 24, 2005\n\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nJoseph Thomas Daley\nBishop of Harrisburg\n10 November 1983 \u2014 11 April 1989\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nNicholas C.

Before his appointment as Los Angeles archbishop, he served as Auxiliary Bishop of Fresno from 1975\u20131980 and as Bishop of Stockton from 1980\u20131985.\nBorn in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles and raised in the city's San Fernando Valley area, Mahony was ordained to the priesthood in the Diocese of Monterey-Fresno in 1962. He was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Fresno in January 1975 and consecrated bishop in March 1975. He was then appointed Bishop of Stockton in 1980. In 1985, Mahony was appointed Archbishop of Los Angeles by Pope John Paul II, and became the first Los Angeles native to hold the office. He was made a cardinal in 1991.\nDuring his tenure as Los Angeles archbishop, Mahony was instrumental in dividing the archdiocese into five administrative subdivisions, and oversaw the controversial construction of the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, which opened in September 2002. He has also been an instrumental figure in the Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal. As a cardinal, Mahony voted in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. He reached the mandatory retirement age for bishops in 2011 and was succeeded by his coadjutor, now current Metropolitan Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Horacio G\u00f3mez on March 1, 2011.[1]\nOn January 31, 2013, Archbishop G\u00f3mez officially relieved Mahony of all of his public and episcopal duties in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles following the release of personnel files documenting priest sexual abuse cases during Mahony's tenure.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and priesthood\n2 Episcopal career\n\n2.1 Civic involvement\n2.2 Controversies\n\n2.2.1 Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels\n2.2.2 Pastoral Letter\n2.2.3 Vocations\n\n\n2.3 Sexual abuse cases\n2.4 Retirement\n\n\n3 Episcopal succession\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and priesthood\nRoger Michael Mahony was born in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles, California, the son of Victor and Loretta (n\u00e9e Baron) Mahony. He has a twin brother, Louis, and an older brother, Neil. As a child he attended St. Charles Borromeo Grammar School in North Hollywood and at age 14, he entered Los Angeles College, the junior seminary of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\nAfter studying at the Our Lady Queen of Angels Seminary and St. John's Seminary, Mahony was ordained to the priesthood on May 1, 1962, by the Bishop of Monterey-Fresno, Aloysius Joseph Willinger, CSsR. He graduated from The Catholic University of America in 1964 with a master's degree in social work. For the next 13 years, he held pastoral and curial assignments in the Diocese of Monterey-Fresno and the newly formed Diocese of Fresno. He was named a monsignor in February 1967, and also taught social work at Fresno State University during this period.\n[edit] Episcopal career\n\n\nStyles of\nRoger Mahony\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nLos Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Roger Mahony, as found on the cathedra in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, Los Angeles\n\n\nOn January 7, 1975, he was appointed auxiliary bishop of Fresno and titular bishop of Tamascani. Mahony received his episcopal consecration on the following March 19 from the Bishop of Fresno, Hugh Donohue, with Bishops William Johnson and John Cummins serving as co-consecrators. That year, the Governor, Jerry Brown, appointed Mahony the first chair of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board, where he worked with the United Farm Workers and various growers in the state to resolve agricultural labor disputes.\nOn February 15, 1980, Mahony was appointed Bishop of Stockton by Pope John Paul II, as announced by the nuncio, Jean Jadot. Mahony terminated two extern priests for sexual abuse during his tenure at Stockton. On July 16, 1985, Mahony was promoted to Archbishop of Los Angeles, the first native Angeleno to hold the office. Mahony was created Cardinal-Priest of Santi Quattro Coronati by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of June 28, 1991.\nAfter the former Cathedral of Saint Vibiana was damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Mahony began plans to construct the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, one of the largest Catholic churches in the United States. It was dedicated on September 2, 2002. Mahony was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\n\n\n\n\nCardinal Mahony with Rep. Diane Watson (D-CA)\n\n\n[edit] Civic involvement\nMahony was a member of the Board of Trustees of The Catholic University of America. He served on a number of committees of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, including those on Liturgy, Pro-Life Activities, and Migration & Refugees. He is still a consultant for the latter two committees. In the Vatican, he was a member of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace (1984\u20131989) and the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants (1986\u20131991). He remains a member of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications (1989\u2013present), Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See (2000\u2013present), and Congregation for Eastern Churches.\nMahony spoke out on provisions in immigration bills, such as the Sensenbrenner-King Bill, debated by Congress in late 2005 and 2006. He wrote to President Bush[2] that certain proposed measures would effectively outlaw the provision of charitable assistance and religious ministry to individuals not in valid immigration status. On Ash Wednesday, 2006, Mahony announced that he would order the clergy and laity of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to ignore H.R. 4437 if it were to become law.[3] He personally lobbied senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein to have the Senate consider a comprehensive immigration reform bill, rather than the enforcement-only bill that passed the House of Representatives.[4] Mahony also blamed the Congress for the illegal immigration crisis due to their failure to act on the issue in the previous 20 years, opposed H.R. 4437 as punitive and open to abusive interpretation, and supported S. 2611.[5][6]\n[edit] Controversies\n[edit] Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels\nMany Catholics were upset about the non-traditional design and the amount of money that was spent on the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. Mahony defended the expense of the new cathedral to replace the previous earthquake-damaged cathedral citing the need for a community to have a religious center that unites people in faith and spirituality. Today, the new Cathedral averages one million visitors each year.[7][8]\n[edit] Pastoral Letter\nTo prepare for the new Millennium, Mahony wrote a Pastoral Letter on the Mass entitled \"Gather Faithfully Together: A Guide for Sunday Mass\".[9] The Letter called all parishes to plan and celebrate each Sunday Mass in order to deepen the faith-life of all Catholics through the Eucharist.[10] Some, including televangelist Mother Angelica, found \"Gather Faithfully Together\" to be gravely inconsistent with existing official liturgical directives set by the Catholic Church.[11] Others, however, found the letter to be visionary, inviting the Church to a more fruitful celebration of the Eucharist.[12]\n[edit] Vocations\nThe number of priestly vocations declined under Mahony's leadership.[13] By contrast, lay ministries grew and Mahony has said that \"What some refer to as a 'vocations crisis' is, rather, one of the many fruits of the Second Vatican Council. It is a sign of God's deep love for the Church, and an invitation to a more creative and effective ordering of gifts and energy in the Body of Christ.\"[14]\n[edit] Sexual abuse cases\nMain article: Sexual abuse scandal in Los Angeles archdiocese\nOn July 16, 2007, Mahony and the Roman Catholic Church in Los Angeles apologized for abuses by priests after 508 victims reached a record-breaking settlement worth $660 million, with an average of $1.3 million for each plaintiff. Mahony described the abuse as a \"terrible sin and crime\", after a series of trials into sex abuse claims since the 1940s were to begin. The agreement settled all outstanding civil lawsuits against the Archdiocese. The deal dwarfs the $157 million settlement paid by the Archdiocese of Boston since Massachusetts law places a legal dollar cap on how much money a non-profit group can be required to pay.[15]\nThe 2006 documentary Deliver Us From Evil chronicles accusations that Mahony knew that a priest serving under him, Oliver O'Grady, a native of the Republic of Ireland, had a two decade history of sexually abusing and molesting children (including one infant) but failed to keep him away from children. The film claims that in 1984, a Stockton police investigation into sexual abuse allegations against O'Grady was reportedly closed after diocesan officials promised to remove the priest from any contact with children. Instead, Mahony reassigned O'Grady to a parish approximately 50 miles (80\u00a0km) east, in San Andreas, where O'Grady continued to molest and rape children. Not long after, Mahony was promoted from bishop of Stockton to archbishop of Los Angeles. By 2012, local authorities had obtained internal Church documents showing Mahony had organized the movement of sexual predators across jurisdictional boundaries to complicate any possible prosecution. In 1987 he prohibited a priest from seeking therapy for his urges on the grounds that a therapist might report the crimes to the police.[16]\nIn January 2013 The New York Times editorialized: \"No member of the Roman Catholic hierarchy fought longer and more energetically than Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles to conceal the decades-long scandal involving the rape and intimidation of children by rogue priests. For years, the cardinal withheld seamy church records from parents, victims and the public, brandishing endless litigation and fatuous claims of confidentiality.\"[17]\n[edit] Retirement\nOn April 6, 2010, with Mahony due to reach his mandatory retirement age of 75 the following year, the Vatican under Pope Benedict XVI named San Antonio archbishop Jos\u00e9 Horacio G\u00f3mez as the Coadjutor Archbishop of Los Angeles with immediate right of succession to Mahony.[18] G\u00f3mez succeeded Mahony on February 28, 2011 after the ceremony of transition held at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, with his resignation taking canonical effect on March 1, 2011.[19] G\u00f3mez is the highest ranked Mexican born prelate within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.[20]\nIn his retirement, Mahony intends to devote more time to advocacy on behalf of immigrants, an issue that he has supported for many years.[21] He resides at his childhood parish in North Hollywood, and is eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on February 27, 2016.\nOn January 31, 2013, Archbishop G\u00f3mez relieved Mahony of all of his remaining public and administrative duties, over Mahony's handling of sexual abuse cases during the 1980s.[22][23] G\u00f3mez's announcement came in the wake of a court order requiring the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to release its unredacted files on clergy sexual abuse. According to the archdiocese, Mahony remains \"a priest in good standing\" and may still celebrate Mass, but he may no longer speak publicly[24] or exercise any responsibilities ordinarily reserved for a bishop, such as administering the sacrament of Confirmation.[22] He still holds the titles of Cardinal and Archbishop Emeritus of Los Angeles,[22] and retains his Vatican appointments including his eligibility to vote in papal conclaves.[25] Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, a number of Catholic groups voiced opposition to Mahony's voting in a papal conclave so soon after his censure; however, Mahony has publicly stated his intention to participate in the conclave.[26][27]\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nHugh Aloysius Donohoe\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nGeorge Patrick Ziemann\nFebruary 23, 1987\n\n\nArmando Xavier Ochoa\nFebruary 23, 1987\n\n\nCarl Anthony Fisher\nFebruary 23, 1987\n\n\nSylvester Donovan Ryan\nMay 31, 1990\n\n\nStephen Edward Blaire\nMay 31, 1990\n\n\nJoseph Martin Sartoris\nMarch 19, 1994\n\n\nThomas John Curry\nMarch 19, 1994\n\n\nGabino Zavala\nMarch 19, 1994\n\n\nGeorge Hugh Niederauer\nJanuary 25, 1995\n\n\nGerald Eugene Wilkerson\nJanuary 21, 1998\n\n\nEdward William Clark\nMarch 26, 2001\n\n\nOscar Azarcon Solis\nFebruary 10, 2004\n\n\nAlexander Salazar\nNovember 4, 2004\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"Cardinal Roger Mahony passes leadership of L.A.

He was Archbishop of Detroit from 1990 to 2009, and was elevated to cardinal in 1994.[1] He previously served as Bishop of Green Bay from 1984 to 1990.[2]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and education\n2 Priesthood\n3 Episcopacy\n\n3.1 Bishop of Green Bay\n3.2 Archbishop of Detroit\n\n\n4 Episcopal succession\n5 References\n6 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and education\nAdam Maida was born in East Vandergrift, Pennsylvania, to Adam and Sophie (n\u00e9e Cieslak) Maida.[3] The oldest of three children, he has two brothers, Thaddeus (who also became a priest) and Daniel.[4] His father immigrated from Poland at age 16, while his mother was the daughter of Polish immigrants.[4] He and his brothers attended public schools in East Vandergrift since there was no local Catholic schools.[5]\nMaida attended each Vandergrift High School and Scott Township High School for one year.[1] During his sophomore year of high school, he decided to enter the priesthood and was sent to St. Mary's Preparatory in Orchard Lake Village, Michigan.[5] He graduated from St. Mary's Preparatory in 1948, and then entered St. Mary's College, also in Orchard Lake Village.[6] In 1950, he transferred to St. Vincent's College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy in 1952.[3] He received a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from St. Mary's University in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1956.[6]\n[edit] Priesthood\nOn May 26, 1956, Maida was ordained a priest by Bishop John Dearden at the Cathedral of St. Paul in Pittsburgh.[2] His first assignment was as assistant pastor of St. Elizabeth of Hungary Church in Pleasant Hills.[7] He later served at Holy Innocents Church in Sheraden.[7] In 1958, he was sent by Bishop Dearden to study at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome, where he earned a Licentiate of Canon Law in 1960.[3] He received his Juris Doctor from Duquesne University School of Law in 1964; he was admitted to practice law before the bar for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bar in Western Pennsylvania, and the U.S. Supreme Court.[1]\nMaida served as vice-chancellor and general counsel (1965\u201383) of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.[5] In 1968, he was elected president of the Canon Law Society of America.[7] He served on a papal commission to draft a due process procedure giving the laity legal recourse within the Church, and participated in the revision of the Code of Canon Law; for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, he worked on the adoption of a due process procedure and chaired the bishops' Canonical Affairs Committee.[5]\nHe served as a member of the diocesan tribunal, assistant professor of theology at La Roche College, and adjunct professor of law at Duquesne University Law School (1971\u201383).[6] He was also chaplain of the St. Thomas More Society.[3]\n[edit] Episcopacy\n[edit] Bishop of Green Bay\nOn November 8, 1983, Maida was appointed the ninth Bishop of Green Bay, Wisconsin, by Pope John Paul II.[2] He received his episcopal consecration on January 25, 1984 from Archbishop Pio Laghi, with Bishops Aloysius Wycislo and Vincent Leonard serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of St. Francis Xavier.[2]\nDuring his tenure in Green Bay, Maida appointed the diocese's first female chancellor and first female parish director.[8] He also established a diocesan planning council and ministry formation program, initiated a diocesan census, implemented the RCIA process, and raised $9 million through Lumen Christi education endowment campaign.[8]\n[edit] Archbishop of Detroit\n\n\n\n\nThe coat of arms of Cardinal Maida, as Archbishop of Detroit\n\n\nIn 1990, the Pope named Cardinal Edmund Szoka, Archbishop of Detroit, to serve as a Vatican official, and subsequently chose Bishop Maida as his successor in Detroit as on April 28 of that year.[9] Maida was installed as the fourth Archbishop of Detroit on June 12.[10]\nOn November 26, 1994, Pope John Paul II elevated Maida to the Sacred College of Cardinals as Cardinal-Priest of Ss. Vitale, Valeria, Gervasio e Protasio.[9] In 2000, Maida was appointed the first superior of the Mission Sui Iuris of Cayman Islands. In April 2005, following the Pope's death, he traveled to the Vatican as a cardinal elector to participate in the conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. Maida is no longer eligible to vote in any future conclaves as he reached his 80th birthday on March 18, 2010.\nMaida is the ecclesiastic advisor to the Catholic Advisory Board for the Ave Maria Mutual Funds and is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Catholic University of America. In 2002, St. Gertrude School, part of the Diocese of Greensburg in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, was renamed Cardinal Maida Academy in Maida's honor. The school, which offers instruction from grades kindergarten through six, is near his hometown of East Vandergrift, Pennsylvania.\nOn March 18, 2005, Maida followed church law and submitted his retirement request to the Vatican (age 75).[9] The Vatican asked Maida to remain archbishop until further notice.[9] On June 8, 2006 Maida celebrated the 50th anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood.[citation needed]\nOn January 5, 2009, the Holy See announced acceptance of Maida's resignation and appointed of Allen Henry Vigneron, then Bishop of Oakland, as his successor as Archbishop of Detroit. Vigneron was installed on January 28, 2009 at the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Detroit[11][12] Cardinal Maida became apostolic administrator of the Archdiocese of Detroit and assisted incoming Archbishop Vigneron with the transition.[13]\nMaida celebrated his final mass at the cathedral on January 25, 2009. This was also held in celebration of the 25th anniversary of his consecration as a bishop.[14]\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nPio Cardinal Laghi\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nBernard Joseph Harrington\nJanuary 6, 1994\n\n\nKevin Michael Britt\nJanuary 6, 1994\n\n\nCarl Frederick Mengeling\nJanuary 25, 1996\n\n\nJohn Clayton Nienstedt\nJuly 9, 1996\n\n\nAllen Henry Vigneron\nJuly 9, 1996\n\n\nJames Albert Murray\nJanuary 27, 1998\n\n\nLeonard Paul Blair\nAugust 24, 1999\n\n\nEarl Alfred Boyea, Jr.\nSeptember 13, 2002\n\n\nWalter Allison Hurley\nAugust 12, 2003\n\n\nFrancis Ronald Reiss\nAugust 12, 2003\n\n\nJohn Michael Quinn\nAugust 12, 2003\n\n\nAlexander King Sample\nJanuary 25, 2006\n\n\nDaniel Ernest Flores\nNovember 29, 2006\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c \"Biography of Adam Cardinal Maida\".

(n\u00e9e McLaughlin) McCarrick.[1] His father was a ship captain who died from tuberculosis when McCarrick was three years old,[1] and his mother then worked at a car factory in the Bronx.[2] As a child, McCarrick served as an altar boy at the Church of the Incarnation in Washington Heights.[2]\nAfter attending Fordham Preparatory School, he studied in Switzerland for a year before returning to the United States and attending Fordham University.[3] McCarrick later entered St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, from where he obtained a Bachelor's degree in philosophy (1954) and a Master's in history (1958).[4]\n[edit] Priesthood\nMcCarrick was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Francis Spellman on May 31, 1958.[1] From 1958 to 1963, he furthered his studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., earning a Master's in social sciences and a doctorate in sociology. He then served as an assistant chaplain at the Catholic University, where he later became dean of students and director of development.\n\n\n\n\nCardinal McCarrick greeting Admiral William Fallon at a September 11th memorial mass in Washington, D.C.\n\n\nMcCarrick served as President of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico from 1965 to 1969, and was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on November 10, 1965.[1] Upon his return to the Archdiocese of New York, he served as both Adjunct Secretary for Education and associate pastor at Blessed Sacrament Church until 1971. During this time, he helped found the Cardinal's Committee for Education and the Inner City Scholarship Fund, which promotes the education of the poor, particularly among minorities.\nHe was private secretary to Cardinal Terence Cooke from 1971 to 1977.\n[edit] Episcopal career\n\n\nStyles of\nTheodore McCarrick\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nWashington, D.C. (emeritus)\n\n\nOn May 24, 1977, McCarrick was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of Rusibisir by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 29 from Cardinal Cooke, with Archbishop John Maguire and Bishop Patrick Ahern serving as co-consecrators. He selected as his episcopal motto: \"Come Lord Jesus\" (Revelation 22:20).[5]\nAs an auxiliary to Cardinal Cooke, he served as vicar of East Manhattan and Harlem.\n[edit] Bishop of Metuchen\nMcCarrick was later named the founding Bishop of Metuchen, New Jersey, on November 19, 1981. He was installed at St. Francis of Assisi Cathedral on January 31, 1982. During his tenure, McCarrick erected new parishes in Perth Amboy, Califon, Skillman, Old Bridge, and Three Bridges.[6] He also oversaw the development of the Diocesan Council of Catholic Women, Bishop's Annual Appeal, and ministries for blacks and Hispanics, pro-life activities, and the disabled.[6]\n[edit] Archbishop of Newark\nOn May 30, 1986, McCarrick was promoted to the fourth Archbishop of Newark. He succeeded Peter Leo Gerety, and was installed at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart on the following July 25. During his tenure, he established the Office of Evangelization, ministries for Hispanics and victims of HIV, and a drug prevention program.[7] He also promoted vocations, and ordained a total of 200 priests for the Archdiocese.[2]\n\n\n\n\nCardinal McCarrick's final homily as Archbishop of Washington in June 2006\n\n\nMcCarrick became known as an advocate for social justice, once saying, \"[T]he Church cannot be authentic unless it takes care of the poor, the newcomers, the needy\".[2] During the 1980s, he served as an official observer to the Helsinki Commission and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, serving at the behest of the State Department.[7] In 1988, he participated in an interfaith meeting with Fidel Castro to promote religious freedom in Cuba, the first meeting of its kind since the 1958 Communist revolution. McCarrick, as a representative of Irish immigrant families, was chosen to be placed in the Ellis Island Hall of Fame on December 8, 1990.[7]\nWithin the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, he served as chairman of the Committee on Aid to the Church in Central and Eastern Europe from 1992 to 1997. In this capacity, he visited such countries as Yugoslavia, the Baltics, and Kazakhstan. He was twice elected to head the USCCB's Committee on Migration, and once asked the Congress \"to recognize and support the important task of nurturing new citizens so that they may begin to play a full role in the future of this nation.\"[7] He later became a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants.\nHe was elected chairman of the Bishops' Committee on International Policy in 1996. His other visits included Bosnia (which described as \"reminiscent of the Holocaust\"), China, Poland, Romania, Russia, Rwanda, and Switzerland.[2][7] In 1995, he hosted Mother Teresa and later Pope John Paul II, who elevated the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart to the rank of a basilica during his visit. Joined by Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, he announced an iniatiave in 1997 to assure that Catholic school uniforms in his Archdiocese would not be manufactured in sweatshops.[8]\nIn addition to his duties as Archbishop, McCarrick was made Superior of Turks and Caicos on October 17, 1998.\n[edit] Archbishop of Washington\n\n\n\n\nPresident George W. Bush and Laura Bush welcome outgoing Archbishop of Washington McCarrick, left, the incoming Archbishop of Washington Donald Wuerl, far right, and Papal Nuncio Pietro Sambi to the White House.\n\n\nOn 21 November 2000, John Paul II appointed McCarrick the fourth Archbishop of Washington. As archbishop, he served as the spiritual leader of over 580,000 Catholics in the District of Columbia and Calvert, Charles, Montgomery, Prince George's, and Saint Mary's Counties in Maryland.\nMcCarrick is the Cardinal Priest of the Titulus Ss. Nerei et Achillei.[clarification needed] He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Retirement and Post-Episcopal Life\nOn 16 May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI accepted the resignation of Cardinal McCarrick as Archbishop of Washington, DC, upon the latter's reaching the customary age limit of 75, and appointed Donald Wuerl, Bishop of Pittsburgh, as the 6th Archbishop of Washington, DC. From 16 May 2006, until Wuerl's installation one month later, on 22 June 2006, McCarrick served as the Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese of Washington, an interim post.\nCardinal McCarrick is currently a Counselor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.[9]\nMcCarrick is an accomplished polyglot, credited by the Arlington Catholic Herald[10] as being fluent in seven languages. Five are known to be English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. The other two are not certain, but it is believed that they would be the church languages of Latin and Greek.[citation needed]\nOn 29 August 2009, McCarrick presided at the graveside service of U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA) at Arlington National Cemetery.\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nTerence Cooke\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nJohn Mortimer Smith\nJanuary 25, 1988\n\n\nJames Thomas McHugh\nJanuary 25, 1988\n\n\nMichael Angelo Saltarelli\nJuly 30, 1990\n\n\nCharles James McDonnell\nMarch 12, 1994\n\n\nJo\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Burke\nMay 25, 1995\n\n\nNicholas Anthony DiMarzio\nOctober 31, 1996\n\n\nPaul Gregory Bootkoski\nSeptember 5, 1997\n\n\nVincent DePaul Breen\nSeptember 8, 1997\n\n\nArthur Joseph Serratelli\nSeptember 8, 2000\n\n\nFrancisco Gonz\u00e1lez Valer\nFebruary 11, 2002\n\n\nKevin Joseph Farrell\nFebruary 11, 2002\n\n\nMartin David Holley\nJuly 2, 2004\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n^ a b c d \"MCCARRICK, Theodore Edgar\".

His father, Pierre, was a farmer who was self-taught, and later director-general of the area's school board. Young Ouellet attended mass at Eglise Saint-Luc (now a community centre) regularly with his family. In retrospect, Ouellet has described his family as religious but not very devout. His childhood interests included reading, ice hockey, hunting partridge, and fishing. One of his summer jobs was fighting forest fires. While recovering from a hockey injury at age 17, he read Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux and started a more focused search for meaning. Pierre was reluctant about the idea of his son entering the priesthood, but it was while still a teenager that Marc told him he had made a firm decision. He was ordained in 1968 at Eglise Saint-Luc. He became vicar at the Saint-Sauveur church in nearby Val-d'Or. In 1970 he left for South America to teach in a seminary.[1]\n[edit] Professor and theologian\nOuellet spent most of his priestly career as a professor and a rector in seminaries. He also received a license in philosophy from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) (1976), and a doctorate in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University (1982).\n[edit] Bishop\nOuellet was named titular archbishop of Agropoli and secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity on 3 March 2001. Pope John Paul II consecrated him as an archbishop, with Cardinals Angelo Sodano and Giovanni Battista Re as co-consecrators, on 19 March of the same year in St. Peter's Basilica.\n[edit] Archbishop\nOn 15 November 2002 he became archbishop of Quebec and Primate of Canada. Installed on 26 January 2003), he has been one of the most staunch defenders of the Catholic faith in the Canadian hierarchy.\nOuellet is fluent in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and German. He is known for his missionary work in South America.[2]\n[edit] Cardinal\n\n\nStyles of\nMarc Ouellet\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nQuebec\n\n\nHe was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Traspontina by John Paul II in the consistory of 21 October 2003.\nHe was a cardinal elector in the 2005 papal conclave, and numerous observers believed that Ouellet was papabile himself. A report said that Ouellet had supported Cardinal Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Ouellet remains eligible to vote future papal conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on 8 June 2024. He is voting in the 2013 conclave to elect Benedict XVI's successor.\nThe 2008 International Eucharistic Congress took place in Qu\u00e9bec City, coinciding with the 400th anniversary of the foundation of Quebec City. Cardinal Ouellet was elected the recorder, or relator-general, of the 12th Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Rome in early October 2008.\nIn June 2011 Cardinal Ouellet addressed speculation about his odds in a potential conclave, saying that, for him, being Pope \"would be a nightmare\". Ouellet said that while \"you can't keep the world from dreaming things up,\" seeing Pope Benedict's workload at close range makes the prospect of the papacy \"not very enviable\". He added: \"It is a crushing responsibility. It's the kind of thing you don't campaign for.\"[3]\n[edit] Roman Curia\nHe is the present prefect of the Congregation for Bishops and president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America since his appointment by Pope Benedict XVI on 30 June 2010. He succeeded Giovanni Battista Re, who had reached the age limit.[4]\nHe is also a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Congregation for the Clergy, the Pontifical Council for Culture, the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith[5] These memberships are for five years and are renewable. Being resident in Rome, he is invited to attend not only the plenary meetings of those departments, which in principle are held every year, but also the ordinary meetings. He takes part in the (generally annual) meetings of these bodies, held in Rome. He is also a member of the Council of Cardinals for the Study of Organizational and Economic Affairs of the Holy See. On 5 January 2011 he was appointed among the first members of the newly created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation.[6] On 29 January 2011, Cardinal Ouellet was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI as a member of Secretariat of State (second section)[7] On 6 April 2011, Cardinal Ouellet was named a member of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts by Pope Benedict. On 7 March 2012 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.[8]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Theology\nOuellet is associated with Communio, a journal of theology established by Catholics after the Second Vatican Council, and with Hans Urs von Balthasar, a renowned twentieth-century Swiss theologian.\n[edit] Christian roots of Europe\nIn February 2011 Cardinal Ouellet said that the relativisation of the Bible, which denies the value of the Word of God, constitutes a genuine crisis that is both external and internal to the Church. He said \"In the last decades, a profound crisis is shaking the foundations of European culture. A new raison d'etat imposes its law and tries to relegate the Christian roots of Europe to a secondary plane. It would seem that, in the name of secularism, the Bible must be relativised, to be dissolved in a religious pluralism and disappear as a normative cultural reference.\"[9]\n[edit] Interpretations of the Second Vatican Council\nOuellet believes that many Catholics interpreted the teachings of the Second Vatican Council in far too liberal a way and by doing so disconnected from the core of their faith. Relativism led to priests abandoning celibacy, a drop in proper religious education, and a general infusion of leftist politics \u2014 all of which was not the intention of the council. Ouellet stated: \u201cAfter the council, the sense of mission was replaced by the idea of dialogue. That we should dialogue with other faiths and not attempt to bring them the Gospels, to convert. Since then, relativism has been developing more broadly.\u201d[10]\n[edit] Pastoral approach\nA report by the National Catholic Reporter anticipating the 2005 papal election placed Ouellet among twenty papal possibilities. \"[P]eople who have worked with Ouellet,\" said the report, \"describe him as friendly, humble and flexible, and a man not so captive to his own intellectual system as to make him incapable of listening to others.\"[citation needed]\n[edit] Catholic education\nOuellet was sharply critical of the Ethics and religious culture course of the Quebec education ministry, saying that it relativized the role of faith within the realm of religion and culture.[11]\n[edit] Church persecutions\nOuellet has stated the Catholic Church is persecuted in contemporary secular Quebec for telling the truth.[12]\n[edit] Public apology\nIn a letter published in Quebec French-language newspapers on November 21, 2007, Cardinal Ouellet publicly apologized for what he described as past \"errors\" of the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec. Among the errors he wrote about were attitudes, prior to 1960, which promoted \"anti-Semitism, racism, indifference to First Nations and discrimination against women and homosexuals.\"[13][14][15][16]\nOuellet stated that his letter was written in response to the public reaction to the statement he submitted to the Bouchard-Taylor Commission, and that it was inspired by a similar letter issued in 2000 by Pope John Paul II.[17]\n[edit] Abortion\nIn May 2010 Ouellet stood by his comments that abortion is unjustifiable, even in the case of rape, and urged the federal government to help pregnant women keep their child. He said that \"Governments are funding clinics for abortion. I would like equity for organizations that are defending also life. If we have equity in funding those instances to help women I think we would make lots of progress in Canada.\"[citation needed]\nHaving earlier applauded Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government for its stance against funding abortions in the developing world, he added: \"If they do not want to fund abortion abroad and they do not bring at home more help to women to keep their child, I think they are incoherent.[18]\n[edit] Bishop selection methodology\nAs prefect for the Congregation of Bishops, Ouellet plays a primary role in the selection of new archbishops and bishops around the world. Bishops appointed during his term have generally been seen as theologians and defenders of the faith. Bishops appointed during his term include: Angelo Scola, Charles J. Chaput, Luis Antonio Tagle, and Charles Morerod.\nOuellet states: \u201cToday, especially in the context of our secularized societies, we need bishops who are the first evangelizers, and not mere administrators of dioceses, who are capable of proclaiming the Gospel, who are not only theologically faithful to the magisterium and the pope but are also capable of expounding and, if need be, of defending the faith publicly.\u201d He also cautioned that if a priest or a bishop aspires and maneuvers to be promoted to a prominent diocese, \u201cit is better for him to stay where he is.\u201d[19]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Peritz, Ingrid (16 February 2013). \"In Rome, bright hopes.

In October of that year, he entered the graduate division of the Pontifical North American College in Rome, later obtaining a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1964.[2] He was also an assistant during the first two sessions (1962\u20131963) of the Second Vatican Council.[4] Rigali briefly returned to the United States in the summer of 1964, during which time he served as a associate pastor in Pomona.[2] Returning to Rome, he then studied at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy from 1964 to 1966 in preparation for his diplomatic work for the Vatican.\nRigali began his service in the English section of the Secretariat of State on November 25, 1964.[4] From September 1966 to February 1970, he was secretary of the Apostolic Nunciature to Madagascar, which also served as the apostolic delegation for the islands of R\u00e9union and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. He was named a Papal Chamberlain on July 11, 1967. On February 11, 1970, Rigali became director of the English section of the Secretariat of State and the English translator to the Servant of God Pope Paul VI, whom Rigali subsequently accompanied on several international trips.[4]\nDuring his service at the Secretariat of State, Rigali was also a chaplain at a Carmelite monastery and a professor at his alma mater of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy.[2] He accompanied Pope John Paul II on a number of international pastoral visits, including his first two journeys to the United States in 1979 (which included a trip to Rigali's future see of Philadelphia) and 1987. He was made a Prelate of Honor of His Holiness on April 19, 1980, and a magistral chaplain in the Order of the Knights of Malta on October 25, 1984.[4]\n[edit] Episcopal career\nOn June 8, 1985, Rigali was appointed President of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy and Titular Archbishop of Volsinium by Pope John Paul II.[3] He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 14 from Pope John Paul himself, with Archbishops Eduardo Mart\u00ednez Somalo and Achille Silvestrini as co-consecrators, in the cathedral of Albano.[3] He selected as his episcopal motto: Verbum Caro Factum Est, meaning, \"The Word Became Flesh\" (John 1:14). He became a member of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre on October 13, 1986.[4]\nFrom 1985 to 1990, in addition to his role of President of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, Rigali held a number of positions within the Roman Curia, serving in the Secretariat of State, Council for the Public Affairs of the Church, Congregation for Bishops, and Pontifical Council for the Laity.[2] He was named Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops by John Paul II on December 21, 1989; as Secretary, he served as the second-highest official of that dicastery. Rigali was later made Secretary of the College of Cardinals by John Paul II on January 2, 1990, and served on the Permanent Interdicasterial Commission, Pontifical Commission for Latin America, and Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. During the same time, he was also engaged in pastoral service to a number of parishes and seminaries in Rome.[2]\n[edit] Archbishop of St. Louis\nOn January 25, 1994, Pope John Paul II named Rigali the seventh Archbishop of St. Louis, Missouri. Succeeding Archbishop John L. May, he was formally installed by Bernardin Cardinal Gantin, then the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Bishops, on March 15 of that same year.[3] The newly-installed Archbishop Rigali became a member of the Knights of Columbus on November 7, 1994. During his tenure at St. Louis, once known as the \"Rome of the West,\" Archbishop Rigali showed a great interest in schools, visiting every high school in the archdiocese.[5] However, Archbishop Rigali opposed collective bargaining by teachers, and opposed any efforts they made to organize. Archbishop Rigali was widely credited as an able administrator and effective fundraiser, although his popularity dimmed as his tenure continued.[5]\nIn January 1999, Archbishop Rigali hosted the pastoral visit of Pope John Paul to St. Louis, the only such visit to a single diocese in the United States during the pontificate.[5] John Paul reportedly decided to be hosted by the Archdiocese of St. Louis because of his longtime close friendship with Rigali.[5]\n[edit] Archbishop of Philadelphia\nSee also: Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Philadelphia\nRigali was later appointed the eighth Archbishop of Philadelphia by Pope John Paul II toward the end of his pontificate on July 15, 2003.[3] He replaced the retiring Anthony Bevilacqua, who praised his successor as \"a man...known for his loyalty to the Holy Father and for his unwavering fidelity to the teachings of the Church.\"[6] Prior to Archbishop Rigali's installation in Philadelphia on October 7, 2003, it was announced on September 28 that he would be elevated to the College of Cardinals, a customary privilege for the archbishops of Philadelphia. Archbishop Rigali was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prisca in the consistory of October 21, 2003.\nCardinal Rigali was the only American cardinal to serve as a concelebrant at the 2005 funeral mass for John Paul II. He was also one of the cardinal electors who participated in the ensuing papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Rigali remains eligible to vote in any future conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on April 19, 2015.\nIn September 2007, the Cardinal was named by Pope Benedict XVI as a member of the Congregation for Bishops, the curia department that puts forward to the Pope the names of those considered to be appropriate choices to be appointed as bishops.\nCardinal Rigali turned 75 in 2010, the age at which Bishops (or Cardinals) must submit a letter of resignation to the Pope, although it is not required to be accepted at that time.\nOn June 16, 2011, the Cardinal was appointed Pope Benedict XVI's special envoy to the celebrations at Prachatice in the Czech Republic for the 200th anniversary of the birth of Saint John Neumann, the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia and thus Rigali's predecessor. Neumann, the second American citizen to be canonized (after St. Frances Xavier Cabrini), was born in Prachatice, came to the United States and was ordained there in 1836, and in 1848 became a naturalized United States citizen.[7]\nIt was announced on July 19, 2011 that Denver Archbishop Charles J. Chaput would succeed Rigali in his position as Archbishop of Philadelphia. Chaput's installation took place on September 8, 2011.[8] Rigali served as the Apostolic Administrator of Philadelphia until Chaput's official installation.[9] After the installation, Cardinal Rigali will begin his time of retirement in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Knoxville, Tennessee, where he has been invited to live (the current Bishop of Knoxville, Richard Stika, served as a Vicar General and Chancellor of the Archdiocese of St. Louis when Cardinal Rigali was the Archbishop there from 1994 to 2003).\n[edit] Apostolic Administrator of Scranton\nOn August 31, 2009, Cardinal Rigali became the Apostolic Administrator (sede vacante) to the Diocese of Scranton following the Pope's acceptance of the resignations of Bishop Joseph Martino and Bishop John Dougherty, Auxiliary Bishop of Scranton. Rigali served eight months as the Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Scranton. His delegate was Joseph C. Bambera, who became the tenth Bishop of Scranton on April 26, 2010, bringing Rigali's administration of Scranton to an end.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Gay marriage\nIn June 2006, Cardinal Rigali traveled to the White House along with Archbishop John J. Myers of Newark and Cardinal Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley of Boston to attend a press conference by President George W. Bush to support a constitutional amendment initiative in the U.S. Senate banning gay unions or marriages.\n[edit] Abortion\nAs chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops' Pro-Life Committee, he remarked during the annual Washington, D.C. pro-life rally in January 2007 that \"there are reasons for rejoicing\" in the pro-life cause: the growing participation by young people and a heightened awareness of the issue's intense and growing moral sensitivity among them, who will eventually have a contribution to make to societal issues. He has publicly endorsed the Pregnant Women Support Act, which he praised for offering \"an authentic common ground\" that \"will proved many kinds of life-affirming support for pregnant women and their unborn children.\"[10]\nHe was the principal celebrant at the Vigil Mass for the March for Life on January 21, 2009.[11]\nHe said that the decision by the University of Notre Dame to have President Obama deliver the commencement speech at its graduation ceremony and receive an honorary degree was \"most unfortunate\" and the reasoning behind it \"evades common sense.\"[12]\n[edit] Conscience rights\nIn November 2009, Cardinal Rigali, with several other Roman Catholic prelates, signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration, which stated:\n\nBecause the sanctity of human life, the dignity of marriage as a union of husband and wife and the freedom of conscience and religion are foundational principles of justice and the common good, we are compelled by our Christian faith to speak and act in their defense. In this declaration we affirm:\n\nthe profound, inherent, and equal dignity of every human being as a creature fashioned in the very image of God, possessing inherent rights of equal dignity and life;\nmarriage as a conjugal union of man and woman, ordained by God from the creation, and historically understood by believers and non-believers alike, to be the most basic institution in society and;\nreligious liberty, which is grounded in the character of God, the example of Christ, and the inherent freedom and dignity of human beings created in the divine image.[13]\n\n\nand declared:\n\nWe are Christians who have joined together across historic lines of ecclesial differences to affirm our right\u2014and, more importantly, to embrace our obligation\u2014to speak and act in defense of these truths. We pledge to each other, and to our fellow believers, that no power on earth, be it cultural or political, will intimidate us into silence or acquiescence.\n\nThrough the centuries, Christianity has taught that civil disobedience is not only permitted, but sometimes required. There is no more eloquent defense of the rights and duties of religious conscience than the one offered by Martin Luther King, Jr., in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail. Writing from an explicitly Christian perspective, and citing Christian writers such as Augustine and Aquinas, King taught that just laws elevate and ennoble human beings because they are rooted in the moral law whose ultimate source is God Himself.[13]\n\n[edit] Stem cell research\nIn March 2009, he described President Barack Obama's lifting of George W. Bush's restrictions on embryonic stem cell research as \"a sad victory of politics over science and ethics.\"[14]\n[edit] Ordination of women\nIn April 2009, he denounced the ordination ceremony of two women in Roxborough, calling it a \"pseudo-ordination\" that \"denigrates the truth entrusted to the Church by Christ himself.\"[15][dead link]\n[edit] Communications\nHe has a weekly series of Lenten discourses on YouTube. In the beginning of 2010 an official Facebook page was launched for Cardinal Rigali.\n[edit] Charity work\nHe is an honorary council member of the St. Louis, Missouri based humanitarian organization Wings of Hope.[16]\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nPope John Paul II\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nEdward Kenneth Braxton\nMay 17, 1995\n\n\nJohn Raymond Gaydos\nAugust 27, 1997\n\n\nMichael John Sheridan\nSeptember 3, 1997\n\n\nJoseph Fred Naumann\nSeptember 3, 1997\n\n\nTimothy Michael Dolan\nAugust 15, 2001\n\n\nRobert Joseph Hermann\nDecember 12, 2002\n\n\nLawrence Eugene Brandt\nMarch 4, 2004\n\n\nJoseph Robert Cistone\nJuly 28, 2004\n\n\nJoseph Patrick McFadden\nJuly 28, 2004\n\n\nKevin Carl Rhoades\nDecember 9, 2004\n\n\nDaniel Edward Thomas\nJuly 26, 2006\n\n\nRichard Frank Stika\nMarch 19, 2009\n\n\nTimothy C.

He was Archbishop emeritus of Montreal from 1990 to 2012.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Biography\n2 Views\n\n2.1 Abortion\n2.2 Political ties\n2.3 Women's ordination\n\n\n3 Episcopal succession\n4 References\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Biography\nBorn in Montreal, Turcotte attended Coll\u00e8ge Andr\u00e9-Grasset from 1947 to 1955 and then studied at the Grand Seminaire. He was ordained a priest on May 24, 1959. In 1965 he earned a diploma in social ministry in Lille, France. On April 14, 1982, his appointment as the titular bishop of Suas (a titular see in what is today Tunisia) and auxiliary bishop of Montreal was announced. He was consecrated on June 29 that year. When Pope John Paul II visited Canada in 1984, Turcotte organized his visit to Montreal.\nHe was appointed Archbishop of Montreal on March 17, 1990. John Paul II appointed him a Cardinal-Priest of Nostra Signora del SS. Sacramento e Santi Martiri Canadesi on February 28, 1994. From 1997 to 2000 he was president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops. Turcotte has participated in the 1993, 1997, 2000, and 2002 World Youth Days.\nTurcotte is known for his work with the poor and writes a weekly religion column in the Sunday edition of the Journal de Montr\u00e9al. In 1997, he gave his opinion about Quebec being a distinct society.[1]\nHe was a voting member (cardinal elector) of the College of Cardinals in the 2005 papal conclave. Margaret Hebblethwaite, co-author of the book The Next Pope, identified him as papabile. Other books and the BBC also identified him as a long-shot possibility for Pope.\nDaniel Cere, head of the Newman Centre at McGill University, told The Toronto Star that Turcotte \"is very much a pastoral figure, much like John Paul II.\"[citation needed] A Toronto priest told the newspaper he was \"your man if you want a pastoral bon vivant Pope John XXIII figure.\"[citation needed] John Allen wrote in the 2002 book Conclave that Turcotte was seen as a \"diamond in the rough, a potentially magnificent leader who is still finding his way.\"[citation needed] His lack of proficiency in the Italian language, as well as his lack of international experience, were seen as shortcomings. Turcotte is eligible to participate and vote in any future conclaves before his 80th birthday on 26 June 2016.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Abortion\nIn 2007, Turcotte presided over the funeral of Supreme Court judge Antonio Lamer, who controversially decided to remove all restrictions to abortion in Tremblay v. Daigle in 1989. At the funeral, Turcotte praised Lamer as \u201ca giant of the law\u201d and a man \u201cwho worked a great deal for justice\u201d.[2] He was not, however, directly addressing the subject of abortion when he spoke those words.\nOn September 11, 2008, Turcotte returned his Order of Canada (appointed in 1996) insignia in protest of the induction of pro-choice activist Henry Morgentaler on July 1, 2008. The return of his insignia happened later than that of others who had protested against Morgentaler's entry because Turcotte had hoped that the Consultative Council for the Order of Canada would revise its decision. Eventually, fearing that his silence on the matter might be misinterpreted, Turcotte renounced his title Officer of the Order of Canada and returned his insignia.[3] This became effective on June 1, 2009.[4]\nIn 2009, Turcotte said in an interview that \"I can understand that in certain cases, there is almost no other choice than to practice (abortion)\", which was seen as controversial in light of his previous condemnation of Morgentaler.[5]\n[edit] Political ties\nIn 2004, he criticized statements by former minister Sheila Copps about Turcotte's relationship with Pierre Trudeau.[6] He had been present at the state funeral of the former PM.\n[edit] Women's ordination\nTurcotte refused to accept the ordination of women after a local synod proposed the idea.[7]\n[edit] Episcopal succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nPaul Gr\u00e9goire\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nVital Mass\u00e9 (Titular Giru Marcelli, Auxiliary Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me)\nDecember 8, 1993\n\n\nNeil E.

His episcopal motto is Omnibus omnia factus. Promoted to the metropolitan see of Managua on 16 February 1970 by Pope Paul VI. He was elected as president of the Episcopal Conference of Nicaragua, 1971-1974; and 1979-1983. He was also elected as president of the Episcopal Secretariat of Central America and Panam\u00e1 seriving from 1976-1980. In 1979 he received the Bruno Kreysky Award for peace and freedom, Vienna, Austria, the Plaque for Peace and Freedom of the Nicaraguan People, San Francisco, United States of America, 1980; the Letter of Brotherhood of the Piarist Society, Managua, 1980; the Venezuelan Order of Francisco Miranda, 1981; the Distinction of Loyalty to the Pope, the Church and the Nicaraguan People, Central of Nicaraguan Workers (CTN), 1982. He was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Giovanni Evangelista a Spinaceto on 25 May 1985, becoming the first Nicaraguan cardinal.\nHe participated in the 2005 papal conclave which elected Pope Benedict XVI. He lost the right to participate in a conclave when turned 80 years of age in 2006. On March 14, 2007, he announced in a press conference held at Unica Catholic University that he had accepted a request made in January by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to preside over the Peace and Reconciliation Commission, which is charged with ensuring the implementation of signed agreements with Nicaraguans who were affected by the civil war of the 1980s. He accepted the presidency \"a t\u00edtulo personal\" (in his own name). In February 2007 he had indicated that he would accept only if the Holy See allowed him. On 10 March 10, 2007, he had an audience with Pope Benedict XVI and in the press conference the cardinal said that the pope had told him to \"work for the reconciliation of the Nicaraguan family.\"\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Somoza regime\nObando was a crucial figure in Nicaraguan politics. He became a vocal opponent of the corruption of the Anastasio Somoza regime in the late 1970s by expressing criticism in his pastoral letters as well as through the columns he wrote for the Bolet\u00edn de la Arquidi\u00f3cesis de Managua. He was critical of the corruption of the regime as it manifested itself through the government\u2019s mismanagement of relief funds after the 1972 Managua Earthquake, and became an outspoken critic of the human rights abuses carried out by the National Guard. The Archbishop helped to delegitimize the regime by refusing to accept the Mercedes automobile Somoza gave him and rejecting invitations to attend official state ceremonies.\n[edit] Sandinistas in opposition\nObando served as an intermediary between the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) and the Somoza government on two occasions during Sandinista staged hostage-taking incidents. In a pastoral letter written in June 1979 the Archbishop spoke in favor of the Sandinistas' use of armed force to overthrow the Somoza regime and encouraged Nicaraguans not to fear socialism. As a result of his criticism of the Somoza regime, the Archbishop was often referred to by the government as \u201cComandante Miguel\u201d (painting him as a Sandinista leader).\n[edit] Sandinistas in power\nThe Archbishop\u2019s relationship with the Sandinistas altered dramatically by the early 1980s; he ultimately became one of the most vocal domestic opponents of the revolutionary government.\nHe opposed the \"people's church\" (radical clergy who supported liberation theology), and banned the Misa Campesina Nicarag\u00fcense (Nicaraguan peasants' mass). He insisted on the canonical obligation of the clergy to refuse to undertake the exercise of civil power.[2] Thus, the Jesuit priest Fernando Cardenal (a brother of the poet priest Ernesto Cardenal), who refused to resign from his position as Minister of Education in the Sandinista government, was expelled from his order in 1984.[3]\nObando opposed what he called the \"godless communism\" of the Sandinistas. He criticized many of their policies, including military conscription and restrictions of press freedoms, and accused the Sandinistas of human rights violations. The Sandinistas, in turn, complained that he should have attacked US aid to the Contras. Initially, Obando y Bravo had promised to the public that if human rights abuses on the part of the Contras were verifiably reported, he would denounce them. However, when many such abuses were reported by organizations (including Human Rights Watch and several human rights groups established by clergy of the Catholic Church itself), he did not denounce them as he had pledged to. Instead, he travelled to the United States in January 1986 and declared his support for the Contras thereby encouraging the U.S. Congress to provide them with military aid. This set the stage for a sharp confrontation between him and the Sandinista government. The Sandinistas, who already in July 1984 had expelled ten foreign priests (who had expressed solidarity with another religious figure who had been accused of being a contrarevolutionary),[3] responded by rebuking Obando y Bravo repeatedly in public forums. Despite the popular support the Sandinistas enjoyed at the time, this episode certainly damaged that support, as Obando y Bravo was (as reported by journalist Stephen Kinzer) enduringly popular among Christian Nicaraguans.\n[edit] Allegations of Anti-Semitism\nDue to some of his interpretations of the role of Jews in Christian scripture, Obando y Bravo has been criticized as anti-semitic by scholars including Noam Chomsky. In particular, he has accused Jews of deicide: \"the leaders of Israel... mistreated [the prophets], beat them, killed them. Finally as supreme proof of his love, God sent his Divine Son; but they... also killed him, crucifying him.\" He also was criticized for saying \"the Jews killed the prophets and finally the son of God.. such idolatry calls forth the heavens' vengeance.\"\n[edit] Health\nCardinal Obando y Bravo is suffering from brain cancer and is presenting symptoms such as mental confusion, disorientation and intense headaches. On 18 August 2012 it was reported that he had minor ambulatory surgery.\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Honorary Doctoral Degrees at Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn\n^ Cf. canon 285 \u00a73 of the Code of Canon Law\n^ a b El Pa\u00eds, 17 July 1984\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nHonorary Doctoral Degrees, Universidad Francisco Marroqu\u00edn\n\n[edit] See also\n\nThe Catholic Church and the Nicaraguan Revolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nt\ne\n\n\nAnti-Christian sentiment and Persecution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy incident\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Christianity\n\n\n\n\nNew Testament\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Empire\n\n\n\n\nGreat Fire of Rome\nPersecution in Lyon\nDecian persecution\nDiocletianic Persecution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly modern\n\n\n\n\nFrench Revolution\nRevolt in the Vend\u00e9e\nMartyrs of Japan\nBoxer Rebellion\nCaptivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern\n\n\n\n\n1860 Lebanon conflict\nMassacres of Diyarbakir\nAdana massacre\nHamidian massacres\nArmenian genocide\nAssyrian genocide\nGreek genocide\nDamour massacre\nIstanbul pogrom\nEastern Bloc\nTerrible Triangle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy person\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly Christianity\n\n\n\n\nAgrippa I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Empire\n\n\n\n\nNero\nDomitian\nSeptimius Severus\nMaximinus Thrax\nDecius\nValerian\nDiocletian\nMaximian\nGalerius\nJulian the Apostate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly modern\n\n\n\n\nShapur II\nAthanaric\nToyotomi Hideyoshi\nTokugawa Ieyasu\nKangxi\nTipu Sultan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern\n\n\n\n\nRanavalona I\nMwanga II of Buganda\nPlutarco El\u00edas Calles\nTom\u00e1s Garrido Canabal\nBai Chongxi\nEnver Hoxha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy country\n\n\n\nAfghanistan\nAlgeria\nBurma\nCambodia\nChina\nEgypt\nFrance\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIran\nIraq\nJapan\nLaos\nLebanon\nMadagascar\nMalaysia\nMexico\nNazi Germany\nNigeria\nNorth Korea\nOttoman Empire\nPakistan\nSaudi Arabia\nSomalia\nSoviet Union\nSpain\nSudan\nThailand\nTurkey\nVietnam\nYemen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy sect\n\n\n\nAnti-Catholicism\nPersecution of Copts\nAnti-Mormonism\nViolence against Mormons\nAnti-Protestantism\nAnti-Anabaptist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartyrs (list)\n\n\n\nMassacre of the Innocents\nSaint Stephen\nCarthusian Martyrs\nChinese Martyrs\nDrina Martyrs\nForty Martyrs of England and Wales\nKorean Martyrs\nMartyrs of Japan\nMartyrs of the Spanish Civil War\nNew Martyr\nNorth American Martyrs\nSaints of the Cristero War\nUganda Martyrs\nVietnamese Martyrs\n233 Spanish Martyrs\n498 Spanish Martyrs\nMartyrs of Turon\nMartyrs of Daimiel\nEastern Catholics in the USSR\n108 Martyrs of World War Two\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nObando y Bravo, Miguel\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n2 February 1926\n\n\nPlace of birth\n\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 3956/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 26946/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 54891/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 29172/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 13/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1749480-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130226124802 ", "Name": "Miguel Obando y Bravo"}, {"url": "/wiki/Jaime_Lucas_Ortega_y_Alamino", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino\n\n\nCardinal-Archbishop of San Cristobal de la Habana\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Cardinal Ortega y Alamino\n\n\nAppointed\n21 November 1981\n\n\nPredecessor\nFrancisco Ricardo Oves Fern\u00e1ndez\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of Ss.

He was ordained a priest on 2 August 1964 by Bishop Jose Maximino Dominguez-Rodriguez of Matanzas. He was assigned to various parishes in the Diocese of Matanzas from 1964 to 1966. He was imprisoned by the Communist government from 1966 to 1967. From 1967-1969, pastor of Jag\u00fcey Grande, his native city; as all the pastors in Cuba, due to a severe shortage of priests in those years, he served in several parishes and churches at the same time. Pastor of the cathedral of Matanzas, and at the same time, assisted the parish of Pueblo Nuevo and two other churches in the countryside; he was also president of the Diocesan Commission of Catechetic and realized an active apostolate with the youth of the diocese; in those years, which were even more difficult for the pastoral work of the church, he began a youth movement that included, among other forms of apostolate, a summer camp for the youth, and a work of evangelization through theatrical works performed by the same youth. At the same time, he was professor at San Carlos y San Ambrosio Interdiocesan Seminary, Havana, where he traveled every week to teach moral theology for several years.\n[edit] Bishop\nOn December 4, 1978, Pope John Paul II named him Bishop of the Diocese of Pinar del Rio. He was consecrated bishop on January 14, 1979 by Mons. Mario Tagliaferri, Titular Archbishop of Formia, Pro-Nuncio in Cuba and assisted by Mons. Francisco Oves-Fernandez, Archbishop of Havana and Mons. Dom\u00ednguez-Rodr\u00edguez, Bishop of Matanzas. His episcopal motto is Sufficit tibi gratia mea. He was later promoted to Archbishop of Havana in 1981. He was proclaimed Cardinal-Priest of Santi Aquila e Priscilla on 26 November 1994. He served as president of the Conference of Catholic Bishops of Cuba from 1988 to 1999. In 1996, he presided the commission for the process of postulation of the cause of beatification of the Servant of God Fr. F\u00e9lix Varela y Morales. Cardinal Ortega y Alamino was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Awards\nIn 2004, the Humanitarian Institution of Merit in Barcelona, Spain awarded him with the \"Gran Cruz al M\u00e9rito Humanitario.\" He has been given an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Saint Thomas, Barry University, University of San Francisco, Providence College, Boston College, St. John's University and Universidad Popular Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de Puebla\n[edit] Views\nOrtega y Alamino has been critical of both capitalism and communism. Like John Paul II, he has urged his nation not to construct a post-communist future on the basis of hyper-capitalist principles. In 1998, he warned of the insidious influence in Cuba of a \"species of American subculture that invades everything: It is a fashion, a conception of life.\"[1] In September 1993 the Cuban Conference of Catholic Bishops, headed by Cardenal Ortega, published the message \"El amor todo lo espera\" (Love endures all things), extremely critical of the Cuban Communist government and asking for a new direction of the country. In April 2010 he said that Cuba was in crisis.[2]\n[edit] Political activism\nOrtega y Alamino is the head of the Cuban bishops' conference.[3] On May 20, 2010, Archbishop Dionisio Guillermo Garc\u00eda Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez and Cardinal Ortega met with Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro to discuss issues concerning jailed political dissidents.[3][4][5] While the rare four hour meeting was potentially seen as being hopeful, Ortega y Alamino said that there \"will be a process and this process has to start with small steps and these steps will be made.\"[3] While the Curia has called for meetings and concessions on these issues before, press conferences to discuss high level meetings like this had not been done so quickly thereafter.[3][4][5]\n[edit] External links\n\nHavana puts on New Face for Pope by Phillip True, Express News, January 21, 1998\n\n[edit] Sources\n\nEmil Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino at Catholic-Hierarchy.

He was Archbishop of Guatemala City, having previously served as Bishop of Zacapa y Santo Cristo de Esquipulas from 1980 to 2001. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 2003.\n[edit] Biography\nThe oldest of three children, Quezada was born in Guatemala City to Ren\u00e9 Quezada Alejos and Clemencia Toru\u00f1o Lizarralde.[1] After studying philosophy at the Seminary of San Jos\u00e9 in El Salvador, he earned a Licentiate in Theology from the University of Innsbruck in Austria in 1959 and a Doctorate in Canon Law from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1962. Quezada was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Mariano Rossell y Arellano on 21 September 1956.[2] He served as parochial vicar of El Sagrario, rector of Beatas di Bel\u00e9n, university chaplain as well as vice-chancellor of the Archdiocese of Guatemala City.[3] He was the first rector of the National Major Seminary of the Assumption in Guatemala, and named Chaplain of His Holiness on 18 August 1968. He also taught canon law at the Salesian Theological Institute and Rafael Land\u00edvar University, and ethics at the University of San Carlos of Guatemala.[1]\nOn 5 April 1972, Quezada was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Zacapa and Titular Bishop of Gadiaufala by Pope Paul VI.[2] He received his episcopal consecration on the following 13 May from Archbishop Girolamo Prigione, with Bishops Costantino Luna Pianegonda, O.F.M., and Jos\u00e9 Pellecer Samayoa serving as co-consecrators, in the metropolitan cathedral of Santiago.[1] He was named Coadjutor Bishop of Zacapa on September 11, 1975, and later succeeded Bishop Luna Pianegonda as Bishop of Zacapa on 16 February 1980.[2] When the Territorial Prelature of Santo Cristo de Esqu\u00edpulas was merged with his East Guatemalan diocese on 24 June 1986, he became known as Bishop of Zacapa y Santo Cristo de Esquipulas. He served as President of the Guatemalan Episcopal Conference from 1988 to 1992, and again from 2002 to 2006.[3]\nQuezada became a national hero by helping to bring to an end the civil war that devastated his country for 36 years.[1][4] He led two organizations that played important roles in forming a peace agreement: the National Reconciliation Commission, which he headed from 1987 to 1993, and the Assembly of the Civil Society, which he headed from 1994 to 1996.[4] He was also the official conciliator between the government and the guerrillas of the National Revolutionary Unit (1990\u20131994). His assistant in the peace process, Bishop Juan Gerardi, was murdered in April 1998.[1]\nOn 19 June 2001, Quezada was promoted to Archbishop of Guatemala City by Pope John Paul II.[2] He was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Saturnino in the consistory of 21 October 2003.[4] He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. Within the Roman Curia, he is a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.[3]\nHis resignation was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI on 4 October 2010, when he was succeeded as Metropolitan Archbishop of Guatemala by Archbishop Oscar Julio Vian Morales, S.D.B., who until then had been Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Altos, Quetzaltenango-Totonicapan, also in Guatemala. Cardinal Quezada was then referred to as Archbishop Emeritus of the see.\n[edit] Death\nCardinal Archbishop Quezada Toru\u00f1o died the morning of 4 June 2012 at a private hospital in Guatemala City due to complications of a bowel obstruction.[5]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c d e \"QUEZADA TORU\u00d1O, Rodolfo\".

He is the current Archbishop of Mexico City and the current Primate Archbishop of Mexico, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1998.\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and ministry\n2 Episcopal career and cardinalate\n3 Episcopal Succession\n4 References\n5 External links\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and ministry\nNorberto Rivera Carrera was born in La Pur\u00edsima, a small town outside Tepehuanes, to Ram\u00f3n Rivera Ch\u00e1idez and Soledad Carrera; he has a sister who is a nun. His father immigrated to and worked in the United States in order to support the family. Rivera entered the seminary of Durango in 1955. He later went to Rome to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University, from where he obtained his licentiate in theology. He was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Paul VI on July 3, 1966.\nFrom 1967 to 1985, Rivera did pastoral work in Durango and Zacatecas, as well as serving as a professor of dogmatic theology and the prefect of discipline at the Durango seminary. He also directed Social Communications for the Archdiocese of Durango, was the diocesan advisor to the Christian Family Movement, and taught ecclesiology at the Pontifical University of Mexico from 1982 to 1985. While at the Pontifical University, he founded the Movement for the Days of Christian Life.\n[edit] Episcopal career and cardinalate\nOn November 5, 1985, Rivera was appointed Bishop of Tehuac\u00e1n by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 21 from Archbishop Antonio L\u00f3pez Avi\u00f1a, with Archbishops Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Rivera and Rosendo Huesca Pacheco serving as co-consecrators. During his tenure, he headed the Mexican Episcopal Conference's Commission for the Family (1989\u20131995) and the Family Section of the Latin American Episcopal Conference (1993\u20131995).\nRivera was later promoted to Archbishop of Mexico City, and thus de facto Primate Archbishop of Mexico, on June 13, 1995. John Paul II created him Cardinal-Priest of S. Francesco d'Assisi a Ripa Grande in the consistory of February 21, 1998. During his tenure, Juan Diego, to whom the iconic Our Lady of Guadalupe reportedly appeared, was canonized. Rivera was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave, which elected Pope Benedict XVI. He was suggested as a possible choice as pope.[1]\nWithin the Latin American Episcopal Conference, Rivera served as President of the Episcopal Committee of Culture from 2004 to 2006. He also holds membership in the Pontifical Council for the Family, Congregation for the Clergy, and Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in the Roman Curia.\nRivera Carrera is seen as a strong advocate of social justice: his criticism of globalization and political corruption so annoyed Mexico's Salinas government that it threatened to adopt a law forbidding priests from commenting on politics.\nRivera Carrera is seen as a conservative on virtually all church matters: in 1990, as Bishop of Tehuac\u00e1n, he closed a seminary that he charged was teaching \"Marxist\" theology; in 1996, he won a showdown by forcing the abbot of the basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe to resign who had publicly questioned the historical truth of Mary's appearance to Juan Diego.[2] Seen as an affable, friendly man, Rivera is best known for his opposition to abortion and artificial birth control and for his insistence on strict church discipline[3].\nDuring the Supreme Court of Mexico's debate on legalizing abortion, His Eminence, The Lord Cardinal Rivera Carrera (this is the formal and proper honorific title given to Cardinals in many Hispanic-speaking formerly Spanish countries, which emphasizes their status as Princes of the Church), Metropolitan Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mexico City and as such, the Roman Catholic Primate of Mexico, had this to say in a Catholic News Agency online article featured on Tuesday, September 27, 2011 article:\n\"Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera of Mexico City underscored that \"abortion is never a solution\" for anything.\nThe cardinal's comments came as the Supreme Court prepared to hold deliberations on a ruling proposed by Justice Fernando Franco that would overturn pro-life constitutional amendments enacted in numerous Mexican states and would effectively legalize abortion throughout the country.\nThe Church always reaches out to pregnant women who are being pressured at work, by family members or friends to remind each one of them of the great value of motherhood, the cardinal said on Sept. 25.\n\"We want to help women who are facing a difficult pregnancy to embrace the gift of motherhood, and the Church is set up to reach out to these women who are truly experiencing such difficulties,\" he said.\nHe also noted that at their meeting last month in Monterrey, the Mexican bishops emphacized that the \u201ctaking of human life through the various abortifacient techniques must not be tolerated, and the taking of the life a human being, even in its initial phases, is not licit.\u201d\nHuman life must never be considered \u201ca commercial product,\u201d the cardinal added. A \u201cchild is always a gift and never a right of anyone.\u201d\n\u201cHe has unique dignity that is personal and unrepeatable, and therefore the technological means for assisting in procreation must always respect this truth and avoid replacing the logic of love with the logic of reproduction as if the human being were the product of the market,\u201d Cardinal Rivera said.[4]\n[edit] Episcopal Succession\n\n\nEpiscopal lineage\n\n\nConsecrated\u00a0by:\nAntonio L\u00f3pez Avi\u00f1a\n\n\nConsecrator of\n\n\nBishop\nDate\u00a0of\u00a0consecration\n\n\nJos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez Zepeda\nApril 12, 1997\n\n\nMarcelino Hern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u00edguez\nFebruary 5, 1998\n\n\nFelipe Tejeda Garc\u00eda\nMarch 4, 2000\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Fletes Santana\nMarch 4, 2000\n\n\nGuillermo Rodrigo Teodoro Ortiz Mondrag\u00f3n\nMarch 4, 2000\n\n\nFrancisco Clavel Gil\nJune 27, 2001\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ National Catholic Reporter: \"Who Will Be the Next Pope?\" 2005\n^ National Catholic Reporter: \"Who Will Be the Next Pope?\" 2005\n^ National Catholic Reporter: \"Conservative bishop to head Mexico City see\" July 28, 1995\n^ http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/abortion-solves-nothing-mexican-cardinal-tells-court/\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nHoly See Press Office: Norberto Rivera Carrera\n\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nErnesto Corripio Ahumada\nArchbishop of Mexico\n1995\u2013present\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nIncumbent\n\n\nReligious titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nRafael Ayala y Ayala\nBishop of Tehuacan\n1985\u20131995\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nMario Espinosa Contreras\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 36601240\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nRivera Carrera, Norberto\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\nJune 6, 1942\n\n\nPlace of birth\n\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 7038/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 40118/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 35329/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 12342/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1687772-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130228042448 ", "Name": "Norberto Rivera Carrera"}, {"url": "/wiki/%C3%93scar_Andr%C3%A9s_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Maradiaga", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0\n\u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga\u00a0S.D.B.\n\n\nArchbishop of Tegucigalpa\n\n\n\n\n\nArchdiocese\nTegucigalpa\n\n\nSee\nTegucigalpa\n\n\nAppointed\n8 January 1993\n\n\nPredecessor\nH\u00e9ctor Enrique Santos Hern\u00e1ndez\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of Santa Maria della Speranza\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nOrdination\n28 June 1970\nby\u00a0Girolamo Prigione\n\n\nConsecration\n8 December 1978\nby\u00a0Gabriel Montalvo Higuera\n\n\nCreated Cardinal\n21 February 2001\n\n\nRank\nCardinal-Priest\n\n\nPersonal details\n\n\nBirth name\n\u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga\n\n\nBorn\n(1942-12-29) December 29, 1942 (age\u00a070)\nTegucigalpa, Honduras\n\n\nDenomination\nRoman Catholic\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\n\nAuxiliary Bishop of Tegucigalpa (1978-1993)\nTitular Bishop of Pudentiana (1978-1993)\n\n\n\n\n\nMotto\nmihi vivere christus est\n\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\n\n\n\nStyles of\n\u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nTegucigalpa\n\n\n\u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga, SDB (born December 29, 1942) is a Honduran Cardinal of the Catholic Church.

He is the first cardinal from Honduras\nIn addition to his episcopal responsibilities, he is currently the President of the Episcopal Conference of Honduras. Rodr\u00edguez was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.\nHe was considered by some to be a possible successor to Pope John Paul II, but he reportedly got only two votes in the first ballot.\nCardinal Rodr\u00edguez was elected on 5 June 2007 as the new Caritas Internationalis President by the Caritas Confederation members at their 18th General Assembly in Vatican City. He was reelected 24 May 2011.[2] As its President, he is the global representative of the Caritas Confederation for the next four years.\nSince December 2001 he has received a pension of 100,000 lempiras a month from the budget of the President of Honduras specified in Acuerdo Ejecutivo 046-2001 published December 7, 2002 in La Gaceta.[3][4]\nOn 12 June 2012 Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga was appointed a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education for a five year renewable term.[5]\n[edit] Views\nWidely viewed as a moderate, he is considered[who?] a rising star of the Latin American Church.[citation needed] His campaign for human rights and the poor have won widespread praise[who?].[citation needed] Cardinal Rodr\u00edguez is further admired[who?] as a dynamic pastor who brokered peace accords with rebels and led rebuilding efforts after a natural disaster.[citation needed]\nHe was the Vatican's spokesperson with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on the issue of Third World debt, and has encouraged countries to give development aid.[1]\nThe Cardinal has criticized Ricky Martin over his use of a surrogate mother for fathering his children.[6]\nHe has said that a politician who publicly supports abortion excommunicates himself, and that it's not question of receiving Communion or not, since he has already done serious harm to the communion of faith of the Church.[7]\nIn 2009, Cardinal Maradiaga agreed with the Pope that condoms cannot be of any real benefit in the fight against AIDS.[8]\nCardinal Maradiaga, in a May 2002 interview with the Italian-Catholic publication 30 Giorni, claimed that in order to divert attention from the Israeli-Palestinian crisis; Jews influenced the media to exploit the current controversy regarding sexual abuse by Catholic priests. This provoked outrage from the anti-Defamation League.[9]\n[edit] Influence in 2009 Honduras Coup\nRodriguez was first Manuel Zelaya's friend. In 2008 he criticized Zelaya for using public money to promote his plans instead of spending it on the poor. He stated: \"We were good friends. But he changed drastically... It was Ch\u00e1vez.\"[10]\nThe Church, according to a spokesman, did not favor deposed President Manuel Zelaya's alleged re-election plans nor a coup. In a televised speech, Rodriguez warned that the return of Zelaya could lead to a blood bath. He also called on the new government to promote national reconciliation and let aside revenge, pursuit, violence and corruption. He further urged the Organization of American States to investigate all the illegal deeds that happened during the rule of Zelaya.

He was ordained a priest in Rome in 1957.\nIn 1961, he returned to Mexico and was assigned to the seminary in Guadalajara, Jalisco, where he worked first as a teacher and then as rector.\nIn 1988 Sandoval was named Coadjutor bishop of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Chihuahua, and succeeded as its bishop in 1992. He was invested as Archbishop of Guadalajara in April 1994, replacing the murdered former incumbent, Cardinal Juan Jes\u00fas Posadas Ocampo,and later that year he was named a cardinal.\nHe was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Sandoval has also made regular appearances on the Mexican Catholic network \"Mariavisi\u00f3n\", which is based in Guadalajara, normally by teaching the catechism during short episodes between regular programming.\nOn 7 December 2011 his retirement was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI; Cardinal Francisco Robles Ortega was appointed his successor .\n[edit] Political controversy\nSandoval has intervened in political issues at the national level. He was at the centre of the macrolimosna controversy in 2008, which involved a donation to the Catholic Church by the governor of Jalisco from public funds. He has also been under investigation by SIEDO (Subprocuradur\u00eda de Investigaci\u00f3n Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada), or the special office for investigating organized crime, which specializes in economic crimes, for possible money laundering. The investigation did not lead to any prosecution.\nHe has organized opposition to the use of condoms, sex education, emergency contraceptive pills. In August 2010 he entered the debate on the legalisation of gay marriage in Mexico by accusing justices of the Mexican Supreme Court of having accepted bribes from the PRD(Democratic Revolution Party) and the PRD mayor of Mexico City, Marcelo Ebrard, to uphold the Mexico City statute that legalises both gay marriage and gay adoption of children. Ebrard filed suit against him in the civil courts in Mexico City for defamation[1] after Sandoval refused to retract his comments.\nHe has made several controversial statements. He has said, \"To be a protestant, one cannot have any shame\"; and on women rape victims he has been quoted as saying: \"Women should not go around being so provocative; because of this there are so many rapes.\" He has been criticised by gay rights groups for using the term \"maric\u00f3n\" (Spanish equal to \"fag\") to describe homosexuals, which is regarded as insulting.[2]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=37892\n^ http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/08/23/mexican-gay-rights-activists-and-catholic-protestors-clash\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nArchdiocese of Guadalajara\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 161701411\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nSandoval Iniguez, Juan\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n28 March 1933\n\n\nPlace of birth\nYahualica, Jalisco, M\u00e9xico\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 6273/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 32534/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 31164/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 10114/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 18/40\nExpensive parser function count: 2/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1466422-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130228045200 ", "Name": "Juan Sandoval \u00cd\u00f1iguez"}, {"url": "/wiki/Geraldo_Majella_Agnelo", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0Geraldo Majella Agnelo\n\n\nArchbishop Emeritus of S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia\n\n\n\nCardinal Agnelo in 2006\n\n\nAppointed\n13 January 1999\n\n\nReign ended\n12 January 2011\n\n\nPredecessor\nLucas Moreira Neves\n\n\nSuccessor\nMurilo Sebasti\u00e3o Ramos Krieger\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of S.

After studying at the seminary in Villa Devoto, he entered the Society of Jesus on March 11, 1958. Bergoglio obtained a licentiate in philosophy from the Colegio M\u00e1ximo San Jos\u00e9 in San Miguel, and then taught literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada in Santa Fe, and the Colegio del Salvador in Buenos Aires. He was ordained to the priesthood on December 13, 1969 by Archbishop Ram\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 Castellano. He was attending the Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel, a seminary in San Miguel. Eventually, Bergoglio attained the position of novice master there and became professor of theology.\nImpressed with his leadership skills, the Society of Jesus promoted Bergoglio and he served as provincial for Argentina from 1973 to 1979. He was later transferred in 1980 to become the rector of his seminary alma mater. He served in that capacity until 1986. He flew to Germany to complete his doctoral dissertation and returned to his homeland to serve as confessor and spiritual director in C\u00f3rdoba.\n[edit] Episcopacy\nGenerally a rarity for a Jesuit in non-missionary countries, Bergoglio became Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires and was appointed to the titular see of historical Auca. He was consecrated to the episcopacy on June 27, 1992. When it was becoming clear that Antonio Quarracino would soon end his term in office, Bergoglio was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Buenos Aires on February 28, 1998. He effectively took over the duties of the ailing Cardinal Quarracino.\n\n\nStyles of\nJorge Mario Bergoglio\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nBuenos Aires\n\n\nWhen Cardinal Quarracino departed from service, Bergoglio succeeded him on February 28, 1998. He was concurrently named ordinary for Eastern Catholics in Argentina, who lacked their own prelate. Pope John Paul II summoned the newly named archbishop to the consistory of February 21, 2001 in Vatican City. There, the pope elevated Bergoglio with the papal honors of a cardinal. He was named to the Cardinal-Priest of Saint Robert Bellarmino.\n[edit] Cardinal\n\n\n\n\nJorge Cardinal Bergoglio greets President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, December, 2007.\n\n\nAs cardinal, Bergoglio was appointed to several administrative positions in the Roman Curia. He served on the Congregation of Clergy, Congregation of Divine Worship and Sacraments, Congregation of Institutes of Consecrated Life and the Congregation of Societies of Apostolic Life. Bergoglio became a member of the Commission on Latin American and the Family Council.\nAs Cardinal, Bergoglio has become known for personal humility, doctrinal conservatism and a commitment to social justice. A simple lifestyle has contributed to his reputation for humility. He lives in a small apartment, rather than in the palatial bishop's residence. He gave up his chauffeured limousine in favor of public transportation, and he reportedly cooks his own meals.\nUpon the death of Pope John Paul II, Bergoglio was summoned to Vatican City to participate in the 2005 papal conclave as a cardinal elector. Although Bergoglio was considered papabile himself, the conclave selected Pope Benedict XVI. Earlier, he had participated in the funeral of Pope John Paul II and acted as a regent alongside the College of Cardinals, governing the Holy See and the Roman Catholic Church during the interregnum sede vacante period. Cardinal Bergoglio remains eligible to participate in any future conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on December 17, 2016.\nDuring the 2005 Synod of Bishops, he was elected member of the Post-Synodal council. Catholic journalist John L. Allen, Jr. reported that Bergoglio had been a frontrunner in the 2005 Conclave. An unauthorized diary of uncertain authenticity released in September 2005 (1) further affirmed that Bergogolio was the runner-up and main challenger of Cardinal Ratzinger during the conclave. The purported diary of the anonymous cardinal claimed Bergoglio received 40 votes during the third ballot, but fell back to 26 at the fourth and decisive ballot.\nOn November 8, 2005, Bergoglio was elected President of the Argentine Episcopal Conference for a three-year term (2005\u20132008) by a large majority of the Argentine bishops, which according to reports confirms his local leadership and the international prestige earned by his alleged performance in the conclave. Reelected on November 11, 2008.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Liberation theology\nBergoglio is an accomplished theologian who distanced himself from liberation theology early in his career. He is thought to be close to Comunione e Liberazione, a conservative lay movement.\n[edit] Abortion and euthanasia\nCardinal Bergoglio has invited his clergy and laity to oppose both abortion and euthanasia.[1]\n[edit] Homosexuality\nHe has affirmed church teaching on homosexuality, though he teaches the importance of respecting individuals who are gay. He strongly opposed legislation introduced in 2010 by the Argentine Government to allow same-sex marriage. In a letter to the monasteries of Buenos Aires, he wrote: \"Let's not be naive, we're not talking about a simple political battle; it is a destructive pretension against the plan of God. We are not talking about a mere bill, but rather a machination of the Father of Lies that seeks to confuse and deceive the children of God.\" He has also insisted that gay adoption is a form of discrimination against children. This received a rebuke from the Argentine president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who said the church's tone was reminiscent of \"medieval times and the Inquisition\".[2]\n[edit] Church and AIDS\nMain article: Roman Catholic Church and AIDS\nHis doctrinal orthodoxy emphasizes Christ's mandate to love: he is well remembered for his 2001 visit to a hospice, in which he washed and kissed the feet of twelve AIDS patients.\n[edit] Social justice\nHe consistently preaches a message of compassion towards the poor, but somewho? observers would like him to place a greater emphasis on issues of social justice. Rather than articulating positions on matters of political economy, Bergoglio prefers to emphasize spirituality and holiness, believing that this will naturally lead to greater concern for the suffering of the poor. He has, however, voiced support for social programs, and publicly challenged free-market policies.\n[edit] Relations with the Argentine government\nSee also: Dirty War\nOn April 15, 2005, a human rights lawyer filed a criminal complaint against Bergoglio, accusing him of conspiring with the junta in 1976 to kidnap two Jesuit priests, whom he, as superior of the Society of Jesus of Argentina in 1976 had asked to leave their pastoral work following conflict within the Society over how to respond to the new military dictatorship, with some priests advocating a violent overthrow. Bergoglio's spokesman has flatly denied the allegations. No hard evidence was presented linking the cardinal to this crime.

During the 1996\u20131997 Japanese embassy hostage crisis, he attempted to negotiate a peaceful settlement, and ministered to Japanese and Peruvian hostages.\n[edit] As Archbishop\nNamed Archbishop of Lima in 1999, Cipriani was proclaimed Cardinal-Priest of San Camillo de Lellis by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001, with the title Cardinal-Priest of San Camillo de Lellis.\nHe was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI, and was himself considered papabile \u2014 a possible successor to the papacy.[citation needed]\nThe cardinal is a member of the Personal Prelature Opus Dei; he was the first priest incardinated into Opus Dei to be made a cardinal. He is also Grand Chancellor of the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa. In 2008 he banned receiving Communion on the hand, instead ordering that the faithful take it on the tongue. He said that \"the relaxed attitude of many priests\" was to blame for a decline in reverence for the Eucharist among the faithful. [1]\nOn 19 July 2011, he was named as a member of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America by Pope Benedict XVI.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Homosexuality\nIn 1997, the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PCUP), in Lima, barred a gay student organisation from holding any events. The organisation, Parenthesis Collective (Colectivo Par\u00e9ntesis), was formed by two third-year students, Rodrigo Vecco and Bernardo Nieuwland. In addition, the university distributed a pamphlet, \u201cSexual Identity: Is It Possible to Choose?\u201d which described homosexuality as a curable illness. The pamphlet was prepared at the request of the university\u2019s chancellor, Cardinal Cipriani.\nIn 2005, during a Mass marking the 36th anniversary of Ricardo Palma University, Cipriani commented on the recent legalisation of homosexual unions in Spain. He denounced the existence of a worldwide campaign that sells \u201cdamaged goods,\u201d calling a relationship that is \u201cnot between a man a woman\u201d marriage, and he warned that by legalising homosexual unions, society is disfigured. He warned that, \u201cIn today\u2019s world, evil disguises itself as good, it is imposed on others, and woe to him who does not accept it!\u201d. The cardinal called on the faithful not to refer to relationships that \u201care not between a man and a woman\u201d as marriage.\n\n\u201cCall it what you want but don\u2019t sell damaged goods, don\u2019t traffic in that dictatorship of moral relativism in which there is nothing good, only opinions and trends of thought.\u201d\n\nIn March 2007, PCUP filed a lawsuit against Mr. Walter Mu\u00f1oz Cho, who was appointed to the Board of Directors by Cardinal Cipriani. In 2010 legal proceedings between the Archdiocese and the PCUP began on the issue of autonomy of senior academic appointments and the University's property rights.\n[edit] Relations with the Jesuits\nHe was also accused of hampering the efforts of Jesuit human rights workers in Ayacucho while he was the Archbishop of that troubled province of Peru.\n[edit] La Cantuta massacre\nCardinal Cipriani said that people who believed that the La Cantuta massacre was committed by the Army of Peru were guilty of \"treason of the fatherland.\"[2] The massacre was later proved to have indeed been committed by members of the Army Intelligence Service, working within the Grupo Colina.\n[edit] Capital punishment\nCipriani has considered that conditions in Peru argue for the permissibility of capital punishment in certain very limited cases, where the criminal poses to society a real threat that probably cannot be safely contained by less severe means, including life imprisonment without parole. For example, shortly after the capture of violent revolutionary Abimael Guzm\u00e1n, Cardinal Cipriani Thorne expressed an opinion that the Shining Path leader should be executed. He referred to Peruvians who opposed the institution of the death penalty as \"cowards\".[1]\n[edit] Human rights\nSince the early 1980s Cardinal Cipriani has been seen as showing hostility to certain human rights groups, including some led by Catholic priests and laypeople. In contrast to his predecessor, the Jesuit Augusto Vargas Alzamora, he has often been accused of not giving heed to claims of human rights abuses purportedly committed by Peruvian state forces during the 1980s and 1990s.\nSome remarks of his have been seen as questionable, most famously perhaps his reference, in a 1994 interview with Caretas in which he expounded his views on human rights, to the Human Rights Coordinator as \"esa cojudez\", which roughly translates to \"that bullshit.\"[1]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 3.3.1\n\n\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nAugusto Vargas Alzamora\nArchbishop of Lima\n9 January 1999\u2013incumbent\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nincumbent\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nBiography at catholic-pages.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority control\n\n\n\nVIAF: 19153554\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nt\ne\n\n\nOpus Dei\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\nOpus Dei\nPriestly Society of the Holy Cross\nTypes of membership of Opus Dei\nNumerary\nSupernumerary\nTeachings of Opus Dei\nTimeline of Opus Dei\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey People\n\n\n\nJosemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1 (Canonization)\nJohn Masso\nJavier Echevarr\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez\n\u00c1lvaro del Portillo\nJoseph Muzquiz\nScott Hahn\nJoaqu\u00edn Navarro-Valls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversities\n\n\n\nUniversity of Navarra\nPontifical University of the Holy Cross\nIPADE\nLexington College\nStrathmore University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchools\n\n\n\nCol\u00e9gio Planalto\nThe Heights School (Maryland)\nNorthridge Preparatory School\nPAREF Northfield School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpus Dei Literature\n\n\n\nCamino (film)\nThe Da Vinci Code\nL'Opus Dei : enqu\u00eate sur le \"monstre\"\nOpus Dei: An Objective Look Behind the Myths and Reality of the Most Controversial Force in the Catholic Church\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurches and Shrines\n\n\n\nTorreciudad\nSt Mary Star of the Sea, West Melbourne\nSt. Peter's Church, Vienna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLists and Other\n\n\n\nBibliography of Opus Dei\nControversies about Opus Dei\nCorporate work\nList of members of Opus Dei\nOpus Dei and Catholic Church leaders\nOpus Dei and politics\nOpus Dei in society\nWomen in Opus Dei\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nCipriani Thorne, Juan Luis\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n28 December 1943\n\n\nPlace of birth\nLima\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 7447/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 39129/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 51474/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 15927/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 21/40\nExpensive parser function count: 3/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1688102-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130228044702 ", "Name": "Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne"}, {"url": "/wiki/Francisco_Javier_Err%C3%A1zuriz_Ossa", "FullText": "\n\n\n\n\nThis article needs additional citations for verification.

For 8 years, he was a member of the Student Center and of Federation of Students and joined different university groups of the nascent Sch\u00f6nstatt Movement.

Taking the name Cl\u00e1udio upon his profession as a Franciscan, he was ordained to the priesthood on 3 August 1958 by Archbishop Jo\u00e3o Resende Costa, SDB. He obtained a doctorate in philosophy in 1963 from the Pontifical University Antonianum in Rome.\nFrom 1963 until 1968, he taught philosophy at the Franciscan seminary in Garibaldi, the major seminary of Viam\u00e3o and at the Pontifical Catholic University of Porto Alegre. He then studied at the Ecumenical Institute of Bossey in Geneva, Switzerland, from where he received an specialization in ecumenism. He was adviser for ecumenical affairs to the National Bishops' Conference of Brazil, Provincial Superior of the Franciscans of Rio Grande do Sul (1972\u20131975), and president of the Union of Latin American Conferences of Franciscans.\nAlong with his native Portuguese, he can also speak Spanish, German, and Italian.\n[edit] Episcopal career\nOn 22 March 1975, he was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Santo Andr\u00e9 and Titular Bishop of Carcabia. Hummes received his episcopal consecration on the following 25 May from Archbishop Alo\u00edsio Lorscheider, OFM, with Bishops Mauro Morelli and Urbano Allgayer serving as co-consecrators. He later succeeded Jorge de Oliveira as Bishop of Santo Andr\u00e9 on 29 December of that same year. Hummes allowed the labour unions to meet in parishes throughout his diocese, going against the dictatorship in Brazil at the time. It was here that he began his support for liberation theology, and forged his friendship with the union boss at the time, Lula. On 29 May 1996 he was promoted to Archbishop of Fortaleza and was then transferred to S\u00e3o Paulo on 15 April 1998.\n\n\nStyles of\nCl\u00e1udio Hummes\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nS\u00e3o Paulo (Emeritus)\n\n\n[edit] Cardinalate\nHe was created Cardinal-Priest of S. Antonio da Padova in Via Merulana by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 February 2001.[1] He later preached the Lenten spiritual exercises for John Paul II and the Roman Curia in 2002. One of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Hummes was often mentioned as a possible successor to Pope John Paul II.\nCardinal Hummes has Curial membership of Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Congregation for Bishops, Congregation for Catholic Education, Pontifical Council for the Laity, Pontifical Council for the Family, Pontifical Council Cor Unum, Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, Pontifical Council for Culture, Pontifical Commission for Latin America, X Ordinary Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops, Council of Cardinals for the Study of Organizational, and Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See. He will hold membership of these dicastaries until his 80th birthday.\nOn 31 October 2006 Pope Benedict appointed Cardinal Hummes to head the Congregation for the Clergy, succeeding Dar\u00edo Castrill\u00f3n Hoyos.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Economic issues\nCardinal Hummes has criticized the spread of global capitalism, claiming that privatizing state companies and lowering tariffs had contributed to \"misery and poverty affecting millions around the world\".[2]\n[edit] Indigenous people\nHe issued an official statement condemning the anonymous attacks on homeless indigenous people. He said \"such violence and cruelty is unacceptable and should be vigorously repudiated. The Church has cried out many times regarding the need to come to the aid of those who are forced to live in our streets, without shelter. She does so out of a duty of humanity and because of her faith in Jesus Christ, who wishes to be identified in each person, especially in the poor and handicapped\".[3]\n[edit] Clerical celibacy\nIn a 2006 interview with Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S.

He taught dogmatic theology and liturgy in Brazil until on 11 February 1981 he was appointed Bishop of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos and ordained a bishop on 1 May 1981.\nAppointed Archbishop of Florian\u00f3polis on 23 January 1991, he served in that post for ten years before being named Archbishop of S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o do Rio de Janeiro and Ordinary for Eastern-Rite faithful resident in Brazil, on July 25, 2001. He officially took over the diocese of Rio de Janeiro on September 22, 2001. In South America, Scheid also served as President of South Region IV of the Brazilian Bishops\u2019 Conference and Counsellor of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America (as of November 25, 2002).\nPope John Paul II elevated Scheid to the Cardinalate in the consistory of 21 October 2003, the last one held by the late pope, granting him the title of Cardinal-Priest of Santi Bonifacio e Alessio (Sts. Boniface and Alexis).\n[edit] Honors and awards\n\nSantos Dumont Medal (September 19, 2002)\nHonorary citizen of the Rio de Janeiro State \u2014 conferred by the State's Legislative Assembly on August 19, 2002\nAeronautical Medal of Honor (October 23, 2002)\nThe Collar of Judiciary Honor \u2014 conferred by the Rio de Janeiro State Judiciary on December 8, 2002\nPedro Ernesto Medal \u2014 conferred by the Rio de Janeiro City Council on September 10, 2003\nMotion of Honor from the Niter\u00f3i City Council, in honor of his Cardinalate, on October 8, 2003\nVote of Applause from the Senate of Brazil, in honor of his appointment to the Cardinalate, on October 7, 2003\nMotion of Admiration and Congratulation from the Rio de Janeiro City Council, in honor of his appointment to the Cardinalate, on October 30, 2003\n\n[edit] 2005 Conclave\n\n\n\n\nThe Coat of arms of Cardinal Scheid with the motto \"Deus \u00e9 bom\", Portuguese for \"God is good\".\n\n\nIn the months during which the health of Pope John Paul II failed, Cardinal Scheid, despite being a known conservative, spoke in favor of having an African pope, which many interpreted as support for an eventual candidacy of Francis Arinze. At the conclave, however, although he has not revealed the inner workings of it, many believe that he might have changed his mind and supported Joseph Ratzinger's candidacy.\nAt the day of his departure to Rome, for the Funeral of Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Scheid granted an interview at the Rio de Janeiro International Airport that caused some discomfort: when inquired as to his opinion on President Lula as a Catholic, Scheid declared that he did not believe President Lula to be a \"true Catholic\", but rather \"chaotic\", since he did not practice or professed his faith. The president was made aware of the Cardinal's words during a layover in Recife, on his way to the Vatican as well. Lula avoided comments on the Cardinal himself or his attitude, but responded that he was indeed a Catholic and that his relationship with God was of a very personal nature, with no need for it to become a public affair.\nThe Brazilian press tried to explore the incident further, seizing the press conference granted in Rome by the four Brazilian Cardinal electors at the Brazilian embassy. Reporters questioned the foremost Cardinal in Brazil, Cl\u00e1udio Hummes, in front of Cardinal Scheid, if he agreed with that description of the President's faith. Hummes disagreed, claiming that President Lula was \"Catholic in his own way\". The reporters then immediately turned to Cardinal Scheid, expecting his response, but he declined any further comments. Although that was the end of the public repercussions of Cardinal Scheid's allegations, it is reported that Cardinal Hummes was not made aware that he was commenting on a statement from Cardinal Scheid, and would have later apologized to him for discrediting his words in public (and in front of him). Some had feared that the incident could have triggered animosity between the two Cardinals, which could have jeopardized Cardinal Hummes' supposed candidacy to the succession of John Paul II.\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nEug\u00eanio de Ara\u00fajo Sales\nArchbishop of Rio de Janeiro\n25 July 2001\u201327 February 2009\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nOrani Jo\u00e3o Tempesta\n\n\n[edit] External links\n\nBiography at catholic-pages.com\n\n\n\nPersondata\n\n\nName\nScheid, Eusebio\n\n\nAlternative names\n\n\n\nShort description\nCatholic cardinal\n\n\nDate of birth\n8 December 1932\n\n\nPlace of birth\n\n\n\nDate of death\n\n\n\nPlace of death\n\n\n\n \nNewPP limit report\nPreprocessor visited node count: 2564/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 18098/1500000\nPost-expand include size: 8786/2048000 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 2082/2048000 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 12/40\nExpensive parser function count: 0/500\n\n Saved in parser cache with key enwiki:pcache:idhash:1769757-0!*!0!!en!4!* and timestamp 20130226004041 ", "Name": "Eus\u00e9bio Scheid"}, {"url": "/wiki/Julio_Terrazas_Sandoval", "FullText": "\n\nHis Eminence\u00a0\nJulio Terrazas Sandoval\n\n\nArchbishop of Santa Cruz de la Sierra\n\n\n\n\n\nArchdiocese\nSanta Cruz de la Sierra\n\n\nSee\nSanta Cruz de la Sierra\n\n\nAppointed\n6 February 1991\n\n\nEnthroned\n14 April 1991\n\n\nPredecessor\nLuis An\u00edbal Rodr\u00edguez Pardo\n\n\nOther posts\nCardinal-Priest of San Giovanni Battista de\u2019 Rossi\n\n\nOrders\n\n\nOrdination\n29 July 1962\nby\u00a0Bernardo Leonardo Fey Schneider\n\n\nConsecration\n8 June 1978\nby\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Clemente Maurer\n\n\nCreated Cardinal\n21 February 2001\n\n\nRank\nCardinal-Priest\n\n\nPersonal details\n\n\nBorn\n(1936-03-07) March 7, 1936 (age\u00a076)\nVallegrande, Bolivia\n\n\nNationality\nBolivian\n\n\nDenomination\nRoman Catholic\n\n\nPrevious post\n\n\n\nAuxiliary Bishop of La Paz (1978-1982)\nTitular Bishop of Apisa Maius (1978-1982)\nBishop of Oruro (1982-1991)\n\n\n\n\n\nJulio Terrazas Sandoval (born March 7, 1936) is a Cardinal Priest and Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in the Roman Catholic Church.\nBorn in Vallegrande, Bolivia, Terrazas Sandoval was ordained a priest in 1962.

(3 December 1930, Belgian Congo \u2013 6 January 2007, Leuven, Belgium) was the Cardinal Archbishop of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). He was the DRC's foremost Roman Catholic prelate from 1991 until his death in 2007.\n[edit] Biography\nEducated by Roman Catholic missionaries, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Etsou joined the CICM missionaries in 1959. He was ordained as a priest on 13 July 1958, and assigned to the city of Leopoldville. He later studied sociology and theology in France and Belgium before returning to Congo in the late 1960s.\nEtsou became Archbishop of Mbandaka-Bikoro on 11 November 1977, and Archbishop of Kinshasa in 1990. He was proclaimed a Cardinal-Priest of S. Lucia a Piazza d'Armi by Pope John Paul II on 28 June 1991, succeeding the first Zairean Cardinal, Joseph-Albert Cardinal Malula. He took charge of Congo's Catholic Church in the final years of the rule of longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, and it was said at the time that he was chosen with Mobutu's support. After Mobutu was overthrown in 1997, Etsou spoke out against what he described as the strong-arm tactics of the new leader, Laurent Kabila, the father of the current president of the DRC, Joseph Kabila, who took power in 2001 following his father's assassination.[citation needed]\nEtsou was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. In a statement to the Congolese nation and to the international community released on 11 November 2006 from Paris, the Cardinal seemed to doubt the independence of the country's Independent Electoral Commission (headed by a Catholic priest, Apollinaire Malu Malu) and the outcome of the runoff of the first direct presidential election in the more than 40-year history of the country pitting the incumbent Kabila against his challenger vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba. He warned of what he called international meddling and accused several officials with Kabila's transitional government of stealing from the state treasury and demanded their resignations. These statement created tension in the capital city, the stronghold of the challenger, whose family is close to the Cardinal who also hails from the same \u00c9quateur Province.

His father was Esan and his mother was Yoruba. Okogie was ordained as a priest on 11 December 1966. He holds a licentiate in sacred theology, and had planned to study in Rome, but was called to Nigeria where he was a pastoral assistant at the Holy Cross Cathedral. He was drafted into the Nigerian army, and served there as a chaplain. After another period of service at Holy Cross Cathedral, he was an instructor at King's College.\nIn 1971, he was ordained titular Bishop of Mascula and Auxiliary of Oyo, and in 1973 named Archbishop. As Archbishop, Okogie was the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, and, from 1994 to 2000, headed the Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria.\nCardinal Okogie volunteered to die in place of a Muslim woman who had been condemned to death by stoning by an Islamic court for adultery.[1]\nHe was proclaimed Cardinal by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 October 2003, and holds the title of Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria del Monte Carmelo a Mostacciano (or in English Blessed Virgin Mary of Mt.

He was elevated to the cardinalate by Pope John Paul II in 2003,[1] and is widely regarded as papabile.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 Early life and priesthood\n2 Episcopal career\n3 Roman Curia\n4 Papabile coverage\n5 Views\n\n5.1 Black man as pope\n5.2 HIV/AIDS and condoms\n5.3 Reform of the international financial system\n5.4 Homosexuality\n5.5 Sex abuse scandals\n\n\n6 See also\n7 References\n\n\n\n\n[edit] Early life and priesthood\nTurkson was born in Wassa Nsuta in Western Ghana to a Methodist mother and a Catholic father.[6] He is the fourth child among ten children. His mother sold vegetables in the open market while his father worked as a carpenter. He had a paternal uncle who was a Muslim.[7] He studied at St. Teresa's Seminary in the village of Amisano and Pedu before attending St. Anthony-on-Hudson Seminary in Rensselaer, New York, where he graduated as a Master of Theology. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop John Amissah on 20 July 1975.\nTurkson was a professor at St Teresa's Minor Seminary from 1975 to 1976, whence he entered the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, earning a licentiate in Sacred Scripture in 1980. He returned to St Teresa's for a year, 1980\u201381, and became vice-rector at St Peter's Seminary in 1981. He also did pastoral work in a parish annexed to the seminary. From 1987 to 1992, he did doctoral studies in Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute.\n[edit] Episcopal career\nOn 6 October 1992, Turkson was appointed Archbishop of Cape Coast by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on 27 March 1993 from Archbishop Dominic Kodwo Andoh, with Archbishops Peter Poreku Dery and Peter Kwasi Sarpong serving as co-consecrators. He served as President of the Ghana Catholic Bishops' Conference from 1997 to 2005, and as Chancellor of the Catholic University College of Ghana since 2003.\nJohn Paul II created Turkson Cardinal-Priest of S. Liborio in his final consistory of 21 October 2003. Turkson is the first Ghanaian cardinal and was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the papal conclave of 2005 which elected Pope Benedict XVI. He was described as \"one of Africa's most energetic church leaders\" by The Tablet, a Roman Catholic magazine published in London.[8]\n[edit] Roman Curia\nOn 24 October 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Turkson President of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.[9] Within the Roman Curia, Turkson is also a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church and, since 4 March 2010, the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses.[10] On 12 June 2012 Cardinal Turkson was appointed a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education[11]\nOn 16 October 2010 Pope Benedict appointed him as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith[12] These memberships are for five years and are renewable. Being resident in Rome, Turkson is invited to attend not only the plenary meetings of those departments, which in principle are held every year, but also the ordinary meetings.\nCardinal Turkson delivered the plenary address of the 2011 Catholic Social Ministry Gathering. The gathering, in Washington D.C. on the theme of \u201cProtecting Human Life and Dignity: Promoting a Just Economy,\u201d is sponsored by 19 Catholic organizations, including the U.S. Catholic bishops. In a recent interview with CNA, Turkson said he has learned from past experience that the Church\u2019s justice and peace terminology often needs clarification for an American Catholic audience. Key terms used by the Vatican \u2014 such as \u201csocial justice\u201d and \u201cgift\u201d \u2014 are not always understood the way the Vatican intends, he said. \"We found out that some of the vocabulary which is just taken for granted and used freely may not always have the same sense or may have had some nuances which sometimes are missed because of the way the terms are used in the American political context,\u201d Cardinal Turkson said in an interview on 12 January at the council\u2019s offices in Rome. Pope Benedict XVI appointed Cardinal Turkson to his post in October 2009, just months after the Pope released his blueprint for the Church\u2019s social teaching, Caritas in Veritate.[13]\nOn 10 March 2011, Cardinal Turkson gave a lecture in Durham, England, organised by the Durham University Centre for Catholic Studies and the Catholic Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle in honour of the late Bishop Kevin Dunn who was instrumental in the creation of the Centre.\nOn 30 March 2011, Pope Benedict XVI announced at his weekly general audience that he was sending Cardinal Turkson as a Vatican mediator to contribute to a possible diplomatic, non-military solution to the potentially explosive civil conflict in Ivory Coast, which could turn into an even bloodier civil war if not contained. There Laurent Gbagbo had refused, in spite of international condemnation and local protests and resistance, to step aside and hand over power to Alassane Ouattara, the certified winner of the presidential election. Atrocities have been committed by both sides.[14]\nIn October 2011 Cardinal Turkson called for the establishment of a \u201cglobal public authority\u201d and a \u201ccentral world bank\u201d to rule over financial institutions that have become outdated and often ineffective in dealing fairly with crises. The document, Towards Reforming the International Financial and Monetary Systems in the Context of a Global Public Authority was very specific, calling for taxation measures on financial transactions. It notes that \u201cThe economic and financial crisis which the world is going through calls everyone, individuals and peoples, to examine in depth the principles and the cultural and moral values at the basis of social coexistence,\u201d it said. The document condemned what it called \u201cthe idolatry of the market\u201d as well as a \u201cneo-liberal thinking\u201d that it said looked exclusively at technical solutions to economic problems. \u201cIn fact, the crisis has revealed behaviours like selfishness, collective greed and hoarding of goods on a great scale,\u201d it said, adding that world economics needed an \u201cethic of solidarity\u201d among rich and poor nations.[15][16]\nIn October 2012 Turkson created some controversy when he showed a YouTube video called \"Muslim Demographics\", which critics labelled as alarmistic at an international conference for bishops.[17]\nAn accomplished polyglot, Turkson is able to speak English, Fante, French, Italian, German, and Hebrew, in addition to understanding Latin and Greek.[18]\n[edit] Papabile coverage\nImmediately following the announcement on 11 February 2013 of the impending resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, at least two bookmakers, Paddy Power and Ladbrokes, made Turkson the favourite to be elected as the new pope,[19] with Paddy Power giving 2/1 odds.[20] Turkson has also been mentioned in regards to St. Malachy's apocalyptic list Prophecy of the Popes, given that its final Pope is named Peter. Odds of 4/1 are given.[21]\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Black man as pope\nCardinal Turkson has said that \"if God would wish to see a black man also as pope, thanks be to God\".[22] The Catholic Church chronicler Rocco Palmo called Turkson the lone Scripture scholar in the Pope's \"Senate\" and believes that his status as a potential \"papabile\" has been elevated due to his appointment as spokesman for Second Synod for Africa in 2009.[23] With the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI in 2013, Turkson is seen as a papabile (potential successor)[24] in the upcoming papal conclave. Turkson also joined Twitter in February 2013 @TurksonCardinal, according to a spokesperson to the Cardinal.\n[edit] HIV/AIDS and condoms\nIn 2009, he reaffirmed the Catholic social teaching on contraception, in regard to statements made by Pope Benedict XVI that condoms were not a solution to Africa\u2019s AIDS crisis and were taken out of context by the media.[25] Turkson did not rule out condoms in all circumstances suggesting they could be useful in the situation of a married, faithful couple where one partner is infected; although he warns that, as the quality of condoms in Africa is poor, their use could engender false confidence. He said abstinence, fidelity, and refraining from sex if infected were the key to fighting the epidemic. He also believes that the money being spent on condoms would be better spent providing anti-retroviral drugs to those already infected.[22][26][27]\n[edit] Reform of the international financial system\nIn response to the global economic crisis started in 2008, Cardinal Turkson, together with bishop Mario Toso, elaborated a proposal to reform the international financial system by creating a Global Public Authority and a Global Bank that consider the interest of all developing countries. The document of 40 pages was officially presented in October 2011 and criticizes the current structure of International Monetary Fund and other institutions.[28]\n[edit] Homosexuality\nIn 2012, in response to a speech by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urging Church leaders to do more for human rights and in particular LGBT rights in Africa, Turkson, while recognising that some of the sanctions imposed on homosexuals in Africa are an \u201cexaggeration,\u201d stated that the \u201cintensity of the reaction is probably commensurate with tradition.\u201d \u201cJust as there\u2019s a sense of a call for rights, there\u2019s also a call to respect culture, of all kinds of people,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, if it\u2019s being stigmatized, in fairness, it\u2019s probably right to find out why it is being stigmatized.\u201d He also called for distinction to be made between human rights and moral issues.[29]\n[edit] Sex abuse scandals\nIn February 2013, Turkson stated in an interview that he believes that the Catholic child sex scandals would not spread to Africa in significant proportions. He claimed that \"African traditional systems [...] have protected its population against this tendency\", and went on to say that \"in several cultures in Africa homosexuality or for that matter any affair between two sexes of the same kind are not countenanced\".[30]\n\n[edit] See also\n\nRoman Catholicism in Africa\n\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ Miranda, Salvador. \"Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson\".

After graduating from the Jesuit-run St. Stanislaus High School, he entered the seminary of the Archdiocese of Bombay and was later ordained to the priesthood by Valerian Gracias on 8 December 1958.[2] He then did pastoral work in Bombay as curate at St. Stephen's Church until 1961, when he was sent to Rome to further his studies. He there attended the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy and the Pontifical Lateran University, from where he obtained a doctorate in canon law in 1964.[3]\n[edit] Secretariat of State\nDias worked in the Vatican Secretariat of State preparing the 1964 visit of Pope Paul VI to India, during which he was raised to the rank of Privy Chamberlain of His Holiness on 4 December.[3] From 1965 to 1973, he served as secretary of the nunciatures in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Indonesia, Madagascar, R\u00e9union, the Comoro Islands and Mauritius. Returning to the Secretariat of State in Vatican City, he was head of the section for the Soviet Union, the Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Bulgaria, China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Zambia, Kenya and Tanzania until 1982.[3]\n[edit] Nuncio and bishop\nOn 8 May 1982, Dias was appointed Titular Archbishop of Rusibisir and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Ghana, Togo and Benin by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 19 June from Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, with Archbishops Achille Silvestrini and Duraisamy Simon Lourdusamy serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter's Basilica.[2] He selected as his episcopal motto: \"Servus\" (Latin: \"Servant\").[4] Dias was later named Apostolic Nuncio to Korea on 20 June 1987, and Apostolic Nuncio to Albania on 28 October 1991. In Albania, he was charged with rebuilding the local church after nearly five decades of communist rule, inviting foreign missionaries to the country and working with the Albanian government to recover Catholic churches and schools.[5]\n\n\nStyles of\nIvan Dias\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nBombay (Emeritus)\n\n\n[edit] Archbishop\nRecalled from the Vatican's diplomatic service, Dias was appointed the ninth Archbishop of Bombay on 8 November 1996.[2] He was an outspoken supporter of the controversial 2000 document of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Dominus Iesus, which declared that non-Catholics \"are in a gravely deficient situation in comparison with those who, in the Church, have the fullness of the means of salvation.\"[6] Dias said the document was \"a reaffirmation...[that] Jesus is the only savior of the world. We have a right to say who we are, and others can accept it or not.\"[5]\n[edit] Cardinal\nJohn Paul II created him Cardinal-Priest of Spirito Santo alla Ferratella in the consistory of 21 February 2001.[3] He was shortly afterwards named to the Council of Cardinals for the Study of the Organizational and Economic Problems of the Holy See on 10 March 2001, and served as one of the three presidents at the 10th Ordinary Assembly of the World Synod of Bishops from September to October 2001.[3]\nIn 2003, he delivered the homily at the beatification Mass of Mother Teresa, whom Dias had befriended during his tenure as a nuncio in Albania; he once said, \u201cReaching out to our fellow human beings, embracing the poor as Mother Teresa did, must become a common service for every Christian.\u201d[4] Lamenting the domination of the world \"by information technology, by New Age teaching and by the decline of ethical values,\" Dias once stated that entire countries are being \"crushed down by godless ideologies and enticing proposals that exalt the anti-God cultures, including the culture of death.\"[5]\nHe was one of the Cardinals considered papabile at the 2005 Papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. TIME Magazine noted his \"[s]trong diplomatic experience\" and said his election \"would represent a bold choice from the developing world.\"[7]\nOn 20 May 2006, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, the top post overseeing the Catholic missions, a post whose holder was once known as the \"Red Pope\" due to the extent of his authority over the Church in mission lands. He was also ex officio the Grand Chancellor of the Pontifical Urbaniana University. His resignation, presented on reaching 75 years of age, was published on 10 May 2011, when he was succeeded by Fernando Filoni.\nCardinal Dias is a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Pontifical Council for Culture, the Pontifical Council for the Laity, the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church, and the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts. He will hold these memberships until his 80th birthday.\n[edit] Views\n[edit] Anti-Christian violence\nDuring his tenure as Archbishop, Dias frequently condemned anti-Christian discrimination in Indian society by Hindu fundamentalists. In December 2001, he invited leaders of all Bombay's religious communities to his home for \"a meeting for peace in a world torn apart by war and hatred.\"[5] In 2002, he denounced pressures put by Indian authorities on Catholic schools, which have \"had to put up with uncooperative and abusive public officials as well intimidation.\"\n[edit] Abortion and homosexuality\nDias also established himself as theologically conservative, strongly maintaining the Church's stances against abortion and homosexuality.[8][9] He believes that gays and lesbians can be \"cured\" of their \"unnatural tendencies\" through the Sacrament of Penance.[5]\n[edit] Anglican communion\nDuring a speech he gave at the Lambeth Conference, his unequivocal language laid bare his disapproval of the chaos sweeping through the world's third biggest Christian denomination. He said: \"When we live myopically in the fleeting present, oblivious of our past heritage and apostolic traditions, we could well be suffering from spiritual Alzheimer's. [...] or ecclesial Parkinson's\".[10]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ \"'I am upset at the media hype'\".

He served as Archbishop of Bangkok from 1973 to 2009, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1983.\n[edit] Early life and ministry\nMichael Kitbunchu was born in Samphran, a district of the Nakhon Pathom Province, and studied at the minor seminary of Siracha.[1] He then furthered his studies at the Pontifical Urbanian Athenaeum De Propaganda Fide in Rome, from where he obtained a licentiate in both philosophy and theology.[2] While in Rome, he was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Gr\u00e9goire-Pierre Agagianian on December 20, 1959.[3]\nUpon his return to Thailand, Kitbunchu served as assistant pastor and then pastor in Bangham, and later became pastor of Calvary Parish in Bangkok.[2] He was also an archdiocesan consultor, and served as rector of the metropolitan seminary of Bangkok from 1965 to 1972.[1]\n[edit] Episcopal career\nOn December 18, 1972, Kitbunchu was appointed the second Archbishop of Bangkok by Pope Paul VI.[3] He received his episcopal consecration on June 3, 1973 from Archbishop Joseph Khiamsun Nittayo, with Bishops Lawrence Thienchai Samanchit and Michel-Auguste-Marie Langer, MEP, serving as co-consecrators.[3] He served as President of the Thai Episcopal Conference from 1979 to 1982, and again from 2000 to 2006.[1][2]\nPope John Paul II created him Cardinal-Priest of S. Lorenzo in Panisperna in the consistory of 2 February 1983; he is the first cardinal from Thailand.[1] Kitbunchu was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.[3] He refused funeral Masses for drug traffickers, saying that such people \"destroy society\" and engage in \"acts of indirect murder.\"[4] He once expressed his opposition to abortion by saying, \"Abortion is a great crime, because the one who should protect the child in her womb becomes the one who destroys the child.\"[5]\nDuring the 2006 political crisis in his country, Kitbunchu called for unity, saying, \"All Thai people are patriotic and want the country to progress and develop on all fields, but now the political crisis has disturbed and worried the people.\"[6] He also asked Thais to \"correct what is wrong and forgive each other.\"[6]\nKitbunchu resigned from his position as Archbishop of Bangkok on May 14, 2009. At the time of his retirement, he was the oldest active head of an archdiocese in the Latin Rite.\nIn addition to his native Thai, he can also speak Latin, English, Italian, French, and Chinese.[2]\n[edit] References\n\n\n^ a b c d Miranda, Salvador. \"KITBUNCHU, Michael Michai\".

He had suffered from prolonged heart problems for some time and died about 2:00 PM of sudden and irreversible cardiac arrest from the heart attack at Lisie Hospital in Ernakulam, where he had been hurriedly taken after fainting while celebrating Mass at noon at his chapel in the Major Archbishop's house, in Ernakulam.[5] The funeral was held on 10 April 2011 at St. Mary's Cathedral Basilica, Ernakulam.[6][7]\nOn learning of the cardinal's death, Pope Benedict XVI sent to Bishop Puthur a telegram of condolence, bestowing the Apostolic Blessing upon the faithful in mourning. He praised Cardinal Vithayathil for his work in support of the Syro-Malabar Church as well as the universal Church and in support of evangelization and ecumenism. The Mumbai Cardinal Archbishop Oswald Gracias, who was President of the CBCI, made similar comments.\n[edit] Works\n\nThe Origin and Progress of the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy, Thesis, Angelicum, 1959.

Speaking of his decision to become a priest, Pell once said, \"To put it crudely, I feared and suspected and eventually became convinced that God wanted me to do His work, and I was never able to successfully escape that conviction.\"[4][page\u00a0needed]\nIn 1960, he began his priestly studies at Corpus Christi College, then located in Werribee.[1] One of his fellow seminarians at Corpus Christi was Denis Hart, Pell's future successor as Archbishop of Melbourne.[4] Pell continued to play football and served as class prefect in his second and third years.[4][page\u00a0needed] In 1963, he was assigned to continue his studies at the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome.[5] He was ordained to the diaconate on 15 August 1966.[3]\n[edit] Priesthood\nOn 16 December 1966, Pell was ordained a priest by Cardinal Gr\u00e9goire-Pierre Agagianian at St. Peter's Basilica.[2] He received a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Urbaniana University in 1967, and continued his studies at the University of Oxford, where he earned a DPhil in church history in 1971.[3] During his studies at Oxford, he also served as a chaplain to Catholic students at Eton College, where he celebrated the first Roman Catholic Mass since the English Reformation.[4]\nIn 1971, he returned to Australia and was assigned to serve as an assistant priest in Swan Hill, where he remained for two years.[3] He then served at a parish in Ballarat East from 1973 to 1983, becoming administrator of the parish of Bungaree in 1984.[3] In 1982, he earned a Master of Education degree from Monash University in Melbourne.[1] During his tenure in Ballarat East and Bungaree, he also served as Episcopal Vicar for Education (1973\u201384), director of the Aquinas campus of the Institute of Catholic Education (1974\u201384) and principal of the Institute of Catholic Education (1981\u201384).[1] He was also editor of Light, the diocesan newspaper of Ballarat, from 1979 to 1984.[3]\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Pell served as seminary rector of his alma mater, Corpus Christi College.[1]\n[edit] Episcopacy\n\n\n\n\nPatriarch Ignatius Joseph III Yunan with Pell wearing his cardinal's attire\n\n\nPell was appointed an auxiliary bishop of Melbourne and Titular Bishop of Scala on 30 March 1987. He received his episcopal consecration on 21 May 1987 from Archbishop Frank Little, with bishops Ronald Mulkearns and Joseph O'Connell serving as co-consecrators. He served as Bishop for the Southern Region of Melbourne (1987\u201396). During this time, he was a parish priest in Mentone.[1]\nPell was named seventh Archbishop of Melbourne on 16 July 1996, receiving the pallium from Pope John Paul II on 29 June 1997. He was later appointed eighth Archbishop of Sydney on 26 March 2001 and again received the pallium from John Paul on 29 June 2001.\nPell was a consultor of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace from 1990 to 1995 and a member from 2002. From 1990 to 2000 he was a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In April 2002, John Paul II named him President of the Vox Clara commission to advise the Congregation for Divine Worship on English translations of liturgical texts. In December 2002 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for the Family, having previously served as a consultor to the council. On 22 September 2012, Pell was appointed a member of the Congregation for Bishops.\n[edit] Church role\nSince Pell's appointment as Archbishop of Melbourne he has maintained a high public profile on a wide range of issues, while retaining a strict adherence to Catholic orthodoxy; with some dispute over the issue of Catholics and \"primacy of conscience\".[6][7]\nPell worked co-operatively with his Anglican counterpart, Peter Jensen, on political issues while avoiding theological controversies. This was referred to in Sydney as \"the ecumenism of the right\". In defending the importance of religious belief in building a just society, Pell worked with representatives of non-Christian faiths, arguing in 2001 that \"the most significant religious change in Australia over the past 50 years is the increase of people without religion, now about one fifth of the population. All monotheists, Christians and Jews, Muslims and Sikhs, must labour to reverse this. We must not allow the situation to deteriorate as it had in Elijah's time, 850 years before Christ, where monotheism was nearly swamped by the aggressive paganism of the followers of Baal.\"[citation needed]\nOn 28 September 2003 Pope John Paul II announced that he would nominate Pell and 28 others to the College of Cardinals.[8] In the consistory of 21 October he was created and proclaimed Cardinal-Priest of S. Maria Domenica Mazzarello. For the first time ever, from Pell's elevation to the cardinalate in 2003 until Edward Bede Clancy's 80th birthday on 13 December 2003, there were three Australian cardinal electors (had a papal election become necessary), including Clancy and Edward Idris Cassidy, president emeritus of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.\nPell was one of the electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. It has been speculated that Pell served as a type of \"campaign manager\" behind Benedict's election.[9] While there was a little speculation in the Australian media that he had an outside chance of becoming Pope himself, international commentary on the papal succession (aside from one Italian source) did not mention Pell as a contender. However, Pell was mentioned as a possible successor to Benedict XVI as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.[10] This position was given to William Levada, former Archbishop of San Francisco. Pell remains eligible to participate in any future papal conclaves that begin before his 80th birthday on 8 June 2021.\nIn 2006 Pell made a successful bid for Sydney to host the 2008 World Youth Day, one of the largest regular international gatherings of young people in the world, often attracting crowds of millions. The 2008 event brought Pope Benedict XVI on his first papal visit to Australia. \"We take it for granted that people will always give to the poor and be concerned about social justice\", Pell said soon after winning the bid, in remarks which spelled out his pastoral priorities. \"But this doesn't just happen by itself. Many great civilisations have shown no regard for these values at all and have even considered them weaknesses...Every society requires a goodly percentage of active believers to ensure that the values of a fair go and respect for others are promoted, and passed on the next generation. World Youth Day will make a powerful contribution to this vital work\".[citation needed]\nOn 18 September 2012, Pell was named by Pope Benedict XVI to be one of the papally-appointed Synod Fathers for the October 2012 Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization.[11]\n[edit] Views\nIn the Australian context, Pell is regarded as progressive on many social issues but a conservative on matters of faith and morals.[12] He has often been wary of what he calls the \"callousness\" of unrestrained capitalism. He has written that a Catholic is someone who is not only a person of personal conscience but \"is someone who believes Christ is Son of God, accepts His teachings and lives a life of worship, service and duty in the community. Catholics are not created by the accident of birth to remain only because their tribe has an interesting history.\"[13]\n[edit] Theology and worship\n[edit] Ad orientem liturgy\nPell supports, in the abstract but not as a proposal for immediate application, mandatory celebration of the Canon of the Mass with the ad orientem orientation of the priest, facing in the same direction as the congregation. \"There's nothing like a consensus in favour of that at the moment. I think I would be in favour of it because it makes it patently clear that the priest is not the centre of the show, that this an act of worship of the one true God, and the people are joining with the priest for that.\"[14]\n[edit] Adam and Eve\nAsked by an Australian journalist in 2012 whether there had ever been a Garden of Eden scenario with an \"actual\" Adam and Eve, Pell said:[15][16]\n\nAdam and Eve are terms \u2013 what do they mean: life and earth. It\u2019s like every man. That\u2019s a beautiful, sophisticated, mythological account. It\u2019s not science but it\u2019s there to tell us two or three things. First of all that God created the world and the universe. Secondly, that the key to the whole of universe, the really significant thing, are humans and, thirdly, it is a very sophisticated mythology to try to explain the evil and suffering in the world.\n\n[edit] Heaven and Hell\nAsked to describe his concept of Heaven for Australian TV in 2012, Pell said:[15]\n\n[I]n some sense we will be there as continuing persons. In some with a new heaven and a new earth with all the good things that we\u2019ve done will be incorporated into the new heaven and new earth. How it will work out I don't know because, I think, physically and morally and intellectually we're at our peak at different stages in our life. How it will work out I\u2019ve got no idea but that is the general outline of Christian teaching.\n\nAsked about the subject of Hell, Pell said that he used the example of Hitler to explain the notion of a need for Hell: \"You think Hitler might be in hell? Started the Second World War, caused the death of 50 million or would you prefer a system where Hitler got away with it for free?\"\n\nWe Catholics generally believe that there is a hell. I hope nobody is there. I certainly believe in a place of purification. I think it will be like getting up in the morning and you throw the curtains back and the light is just too much. God's light would be too much for us. But I believe on behalf of the innocent victims in history that the scales of justice should work out. And if they don't, life is radically unjust, the law of the jungle prevails.\n\n[edit] Ordination of women and priestly celibacy\nPell supported Pope John Paul II's view that the ordination of women is impossible according to the church's divine constitution and has also expressed his opinion that abandoning the tradition of clerical celibacy would be a \"serious blunder\".[17]\n[edit] Royal Commission on sexual abuse\nIn late 2012, the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. In a televised media conference, Pell welcomed the Royal Commission. However his comments received significant media attention when he stated that priests who hear confessions from people who commit child sex abuse must remain bound by the Seal of Confession, commenting:[18][19][20][21]\n\nIf that is done outside the confessional (it can be reported to the police).... (But) the Seal of Confession is inviolable. If the priest knows beforehand about such a situation, the priest should refuse to hear the confession... That would be my advice, and I would never hear the confession of a priest who is suspected of such a thing.\n\nIn his 2012 Christmas address, Pell stated that he was \"deeply sorry\" for the hurt that had occurred, describing it as \"completely contrary\" to Christ's teachings.[22][23][24]\n[edit] Society of St Pius X\nPell has expressed agreement with the lifting of the excommunication of the four bishops of the Traditionalist Catholic Society of St Pius X (SSPX). He has said that \"I think it is certainly a worthy goal to try to reconcile that wing of the Church\", but also insisted that the SSPX must accept the teachings of the Second Vatican Council before it can be fully reconciled with the Holy See, saying: \"I think it would be quite incongruous wanting to be formally reconciled with the Church if you are explicitly disavowing key elements of Vatican II\", among which he mentioned the teaching that \"the state cannot coerce belief\" and the council's \"condemnation of anti-semitism\".[25]\n[edit] Political issues\n[edit] Afghanistan and Iraq Wars\nPell has written that he supported the Afghanistan War but believed that the Iraq War was \"not morally justified\".[26]\n[edit] Asylum seekers and refugees\nPell has criticised the bipartisan policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers in Australia and called for \"empathy and compassion\" towards displaced peoples.[27] Pell said that while a policy of detterence was justifiable, the practice of the policy was coming at too great a \"moral cost\".[28] Describing conditions in some of Australia's mandatory detention camps in 2001 as \"pretty tight and miserable\" and \"no place for women and children\", Pell called for investigation of any maltreatment of detainees and said that, while Australia has the right to regulate the number of refugees it accepts, as a rich and prosperous country, it can \"afford to be generous\" and must treat refugees who reach Australia humanely.[29]\n[edit] Australian republicanism\nPell was appointed a delegate to the Australian Constitutional Convention 1998 which considered the issue of Australia becoming a republic. Pell supported change, and called on Australia's political leaders to embrace the republic, noting \"Without support from most of the front benches of both sides of the parliament, it would be wasteful to go to a referendum.\" Towards the end of proceedings, he called on conservatives to support change.[30]\n[edit] World leaders\n[edit] John Howard\nWhen John Howard departed the office of Prime Minister of Australia following the 2007 Australian federal election, Pell wrote that, along with Bob Hawke, Howard had been the outstanding figure of Australian life since Robert Menzies and that he had brought 11 years of prosperity and \"changed Australian life for the better\".[31] Pell wrote that Howard \"understood that traditional families are the cement which hold society together and he was generally supportive of Christian values\". Pell said that Howard went a step too far on industrial relations policy and that the Iraq War did not go well, but that the \"biggest blot on his record will remain the treatment of the refugees\".[31]\n[edit] John F. Kennedy\nPell describes himself as \"an old Kennedy groupie\" \u2013 referring to John F. Kennedy, the first Catholic President of the United States.[12]\n[edit] Barack Obama\nFollowing the 2008 election of Barack Obama as US President, Pell wrote for The Sunday Telegraph that \"Obama is a superb orator with a gift for language and a capacity to inspire loyalty and hope\" and that the \"importance of a black President for the U.S.A. and the world cannot be underestimated; especially a black President with a Muslim father. No country in Europe could produce such a result.\"[citation needed] Pell expressed a need for universal health care in the United States, but criticised Obama's support for abortion, saying that he had the \"most anti-life voting record of any contemporary senator\" which, Pell wrote, \"contrasts strongly with his humanitarianism in many other areas\". Pell said that Obama would have to move beyond the \"radical left\" if he wanted to \"win over the middle ground in the fight for healing and prosperity\".[32] In a 2009 interview with The Catholic Herald, Pell said of Obama, \"[H]is record on life issues is very, very bad indeed\" and expressed his opposition to the Freedom of Choice Act.[14]\n[edit] Kevin Rudd\nWhen the Australian Labor Party replaced Kevin Rudd as its leader in 2010 and Julia Gillard became the Prime Minister of Australia, Pell wrote that \"As leaders Rudd and Opposition leader Tony Abbott are historically unusual by Australian standards because both worship regularly and have publicly acknowledged the huge Christian contribution to Australia. The rise and fall of Kevin Rudd has no parallel nationally. While he talked himself out of his job with his inflated rhetoric, he had many virtues and Australia avoided recession. John Howard was voted out by the Australian public; Rudd's departure will leave a nasty taste in many mouths.\"[33]\n[edit] Environmental concerns\nPell aroused criticism from Senator Christine Milne of the Greens political party with the following comment in his 2006 Legatus Summit speech:[34]\n\nSome of the hysteric and extreme claims about global warming are also a symptom of pagan emptiness, of Western fear when confronted by the immense and basically uncontrollable forces of nature. Belief in a benign God who is master of the universe has a steadying psychological effect, although it is no guarantee of Utopia, no guarantee that the continuing climate and geographic changes will be benign. In the past pagans sacrificed animals and even humans in vain attempts to placate capricious and cruel gods. Today they demand a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nIn a 2007 article for The Sunday Telegraph, Pell wrote that while climate had changed, he was '\"certainly sceptical about extravagant claims of impending man-made climatic catastrophes, because the evidence is insufficient\".[35]\nResponding to the Anglican bishop and environmentalist George Browning, who told the Anglican Church of Australia's general synod that Pell was out of touch with the Catholic Church as well as with the general community,[36] Pell stated:[37]\n\nRadical environmentalists are more than up to the task of moralising their own agenda and imposing it on people through fear. They don't need church leaders to help them with this, although it is a very effective way of further muting Christian witness. Church leaders in particular should be allergic to nonsense..... I am certainly sceptical about extravagant claims of impending man-made climatic catastrophes. Uncertainties on climate change abound ... my task as a Christian leader is to engage with reality, to contribute to debate on important issues, to open people's minds, and to point out when the emperor is wearing few or no clothes.\n\n[edit] Interfaith issues\n[edit] Islam\nPell has written of a need to \"deepen friendship and understanding\" with Muslims in the post\u201311 September environment and has said that though there is a continuing struggle throughout the Muslim world between moderates and men of violence, he believes that, in Australia, \"the moderates are in control\".[38]\nIn 2004, speaking to the Acton Institute on the problems of \"secular democracy\", Pell drew a parallel between Islam and Communism: \"Islam may provide in the 21st century, the attraction that communism provided in the 20th, both for those that are alienated and embittered on the one hand and for those who seek order or justice on the other.\"[39]\nIn 2006, at the Legatus Summit in Naples, Florida, Pell stated:[34]\n\nConsidered strictly on its own terms, Islam is not a tolerant religion and its capacity for far-reaching renovation is severely limited.\n\nHowever, he added that the human factor of many Muslims being uncomfortable with the violence and harsh intolerance of traditional Islamic practices provides hope for positive change as has occurred in more moderate Muslim nations. He continued by:[34]\n\n....denouncing the blithe encouragement of large scale Islamic migration into Western nations [as] one example of the secular incomprehension of religion [and claimed that Islam has had a] detrimental impact on economic and cultural development at certain times and in certain places...\n\n[edit] Judaism\nPell has participated in many interfaith dialogues and celebrations involving Jewish people. In 2001, he told one such audience at Mandelbaum House that he had come from a strongly pro-Jewish family and of being saddened during his studies of history to find Christian ill-treatment of Jews. Pell spoke of the need to remember the Holocaust and of his visits to Concentration camps and of his support for the right of the state of Israel to exist. He praised the role of Vatican II and of Pope John Paul II in advancing the cause of Christian-Jewish dialogue and co-operation. Pell also spoke in praise of the Jewish psalms as \"a body of prayerful literature\" unequalled in any other tradition and singled out the Jewish prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel as authors for whom he has a deep love and Elijah as one whom he views as highly significant. Pell called on Christian and Jewish leaders alike to speak together and respectfully listen to each other, saying of the Christian-Jewish relationship:[40]\n\nDuring the last 30 or 40 years there has been a significant reduction in the amount of Christian anti-Semitism. We thank God for that. To adapt to our circumstances the word of Martin Luther King \"we are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly\". Our fortunes, as brothers, are inextricably linked.\n\nDuring a televised 2012 debate with Richard Dawkins, Pell stated that he had \"a great admiration for the Jews\" and repeatedly condemned Adolf Hitler. During the course of the debate, ABC moderator Tony Jones sought to imply anti-Semitism in Pell's remarks regarding the relative intellectual development of ancient Jewish society with that of great powers like Egypt, as well as in Pell's comment that Germany was punished for its role in the Second World War.[41]\nIn responding to a series of questions by Jones as to why God would \"randomly decide to provide proof of his existence to a small group of Jews 2,000 years ago\", Pell said that, while the intellectual life of the ancient Jews was not the equal of the surrounding great powers like Egypt, Persia and Chaldea, \"Jesus came not as a philosopher to the elite. He came to the poor and the battlers\". Jones cross examined Pell over his use of the word \"intellectual\" and Pell said (in reference to Biblical times) that \"the little Jewish people, they were originally shepherds. They were stuck. They\u2019re still stuck between these great powers.\"[15]\nReferring to events like \"The Holocaust, to genocide, to famine\", Jones asked why an omnipotent God would permit such events to occur. In response, Pell and Jones had the following exchange:[15]\n\n\nPell: That\u2019s a mighty question. He helped probably through secondary causes for the Jews to escape and continue. It is interesting through these secondary causes probably no people in history have been punished the way the Germans were. It is a terrible mystery.\nModerator: There would be a very strong argument saying that the Jews of Europe suffered worse than the Germans.\nPell: Yes, that might be right. Certainly the suffering in both I mean the Jews there was no reason why they should suffer.\n\n\nPell's remarks were widely misreported and misinterpreted, leading to a clarification from his office \u2013 reported by The Times of Israel as an apology.[42] Pell said that \"... my commitment to friendship with the Jewish community, and my esteem for the Jewish faith is a matter of public record, and the last thing I would want to do is give offense to either\" and that the Holocaust was \"a crime unique in history for the death and suffering it caused and its diabolical attempt to wipe out an entire people.\"[42][43]\n[edit] Sexuality, marriage and bioethics\nPell has received much attention for his attitudes to sexuality issues, particularly homosexuality. He has said that \"Christian teaching on sexuality is only one part of the Ten Commandments, of the virtues and vices, but it is essential for human wellbeing and especially for the proper flourishing of marriages and families, for the continuity of the human race.\"[44] Upon becoming Archbishop of Sydney, he stated \"Any genuine religion has two important moral tasks; firstly, to present norms and ideals, goals for our striving; and secondly, to offer aids for our weakness, forgiveness and healing for every wrong doer and sinner who repents and seeks forgiveness.\"[44]\n[edit] Divorce\nPell says that, outside exceptional circumstances such as relationships involving physical abuse, it is better for individuals and for society if couples do not divorce, particularly where children are involved.[45]\nIn 2001, ABC radio's The World Today reported that Pell wanted a return to a divorce system based on the fault of one spouse. Pell told the program that, in an effort to \"focus attention on the damage, personal and financial, that unfortunately often follows from divorce\" he had prepared a list for public consideration of possible penalties to discourage divorce (particularly where fault by one party was involved); as well as benefits to support couples who stayed together. Other interviewees rejected these proposals: the Law Council's Garry Watts, said that benefits to children would not come and that Pell proposed to \"imprison\" unhappy parents in dysfunctional marriages. Canon Ray Cleary, director of Anglicare in Victoria, said a punitive response to divorce would be \"out of touch with the realities of the modern world\".[46]\n[edit] HIV / AIDS\nMain article: Religion and AIDS\nIn 2009, Pell supported the comments made by Pope Benedict XVI in Africa in relation to controlling the spread of AIDS, in which the Pope reiterated the Catholic teaching that the solution to the AIDS epidemic lay not in the distribution of condoms, but in the practice of sexual abstinence and monogamy within marriage. The Pope said that AIDS could not be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which \"can even increase the problem\". In response to global coverage of these remarks, Pell said that AIDS was \"great spiritual and health crisis\" and a huge challenge, but that \"Condoms are encouraging promiscuity. They are encouraging irresponsibility.\"[47] Pell told the media.[47]\n\nThe idea that you can solve a great spiritual and health crisis like AIDS with a few mechanical contraptions like condoms is ridiculous. If you look at the Philippines you'll see the incidence of AIDS is much lower than it is in Thailand, which is awash with condoms. There are condoms everywhere and the rate of infection is enormous.\n\nThe president of the AIDS Council of NSW, Marc Orr, said Pell's comments were \"irresponsible\" and \"contradicted all evidence\" that condoms reduced the transmission of HIV:[48] Mike Toole (Burnet Institute) and Rob Moodie (Nossal Institute for Global Health) wrote in The Age that Pell had said a health worker from an African country told him that \"people in remote areas are too poor to afford condoms and the ones that are available are often of very poor quality and weren't used effectively\". Both professors argue that \"this is not an argument against promoting condoms \u2013 it is an argument that we need to ensure that good quality condoms are affordable for everyone and are widely distributed with information about how to use them effectively\" and concluded \"the sexual abstinence message is clearly not working.\"[49]\nIn 2010, in Light of the World: The Pope, the Church and the Signs of the Times, a book-length interview by German journalist Peter Seewald, Pope Benedict said that while the church did not consider condoms as a \"real or moral solution\", there were times where the \"intention of reducing the risk of infection\" made condom use \"a first step\" towards a better way. Pell released a statement saying this did not signal a major new shift in Vatican thinking.[50]\nAs Archbishop of Sydney, Pell has strongly supported the work of Catholic health organisations such as St Vincent's Hospital and the Tree of Hope Centre in caring for those living with HIV/AIDS.[51]\n[edit] Stem cell debate controversy\nPell supports research on the therapeutic potential of adult stem cells but opposes embryonic stem cell research on the basis that the church cannot support anything which involves \"the destruction of human life at any stage after conception\". Under Pell, the Sydney archdiocese has provided funding for adult stem cell research but has actively opposed moves by New South Wales Parliament to liberalise laws pertaining to use of embryonic stem cells.[13][52]\nIn remarks made at a media conference, in June 2007 on a conscience vote overturning the state ban on therapeutic cloning, Pell said that \"Catholic politicians who vote for this legislation must realise that their voting has consequences for their place in the life of the Church\". Some members[who?] of parliament condemned Pell's comments, calling them hypocritical and drawing comparisons with comments made earlier in the year by Sheik Hilali.[53][54] Australian Greens MLC Lee Rhiannon referred Pell's remarks to the New South Wales parliamentary privileges committee for allegedly being in \"contempt of parliament\". Pell described this move as a \"clumsy attempt to curb religious freedom and freedom of speech\".[55] In September the Committee tabled a report clearing him of this charge and recommending that no further action be taken.[56]\n[edit] Health\nIn February 2010 it was reported that Pell \"had a heart turn in Rome recently and that he's in hospital there or has been in hospital there\". It is thought that Pell was taken to hospital when he first arrived in Rome after he collapsed due to ill health and exhaustion. He was released from hospital the same day and sources close to Pell said that he has been in good health since.[57]\n[edit] Eulogy reforms\nIn February 2007 Pell instituted new guidelines when it comes for family members to speak at funerals. He said that, \"on not a few occasions, inappropriate remarks glossing over the deceased's proclivities (drinking prowess, romantic conquests etc) or about the Church (attacking its moral teachings) have been made at funeral Masses.\"[58] Pell's guidelines make it clear that the eulogy must never replace the officiating priest's homily, which should focus on God's compassion and the resurrection of Jesus.\n[edit] Other roles\nThe Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney takes the role of Visitor[citation needed] of St John's College, a residential college within the University of Sydney. This is a largely ceremonial role but he can also be called upon to give guidance and resolve internal disputes. Under the direction of the archbishop the college associates itself with the interests of the church and its mission, particularly by the fostering of appropriate academic directions in education, charity, social justice, ethics and the environment.\nPell accepted the invitation to be patron of the Oxford University Newman Society and to deliver their inaugural St Thomas More Lecture on 6 March 2009.[citation needed]\nPell is a regular contributor of articles for the Australian media, including regular columns for Sydney's The Sunday Telegraph newspaper.\n[edit] Accusation of sexual abuse\nIn June 2002, Pell was accused of having sexually abused a 12-year-old boy at a Roman Catholic youth camp in 1961 whilst a seminarian. Pell vigorously denied all the accusations and stood aside as soon as the allegations were made public,[59] but he did not resign as archbishop. The complainant agreed to pursue his allegations through the church's own process for dealing with allegations of sexual misconduct, the National Committee for Professional Standards (NCPS). The subsequent inquiry found that the accusations had not been established.[60] Justice Southwell concluded:[61]\n\n[B]earing in mind the... very long delay, some valid criticism of the complainant's credibility, the lack of corroborative evidence and the sworn denial of the respondent, I find I am not 'satisfied that the complaint has been established'.\n\n[edit] Writings and media\nPell has written widely in religious and secular magazines, learned journals and newspapers in Australia and overseas and regularly speaks on television and radio. In September 1996 Oxford University Press published his Issues of Faith and Morals, written for senior secondary classes and parish groups. His other publications include The Sisters of St Joseph in Swan Hill 1922\u201372 (1972), Catholicism in Australia (1988), Rerum Novarum \u2013 One Hundred Years Later (1992), Catholicism and the Architecture of Freedom (1999) and Be Not Afraid, a collection of homilies and reflections published in 2004. A biography of Pell was published by Queensland journalist Tess Livingstone in 2002.\n[edit] Published works\n\nPell, George (1977) (pamphlet).

He obtained a Bachelor of Commerce degree at Victoria University, Wellington, and worked for some years as an accountant. During his studies, he was deeply involved in the Catholic Youth Movement (YCW) and for a period worked full-time for the movement. In 1954 he commenced studies for the priesthood at the National Seminary, Holy Cross College, Mosgiel, Dunedin.\nIn 1956 he was sent to the Pontifical Urban University in Rome, where he obtained a licentiate in theology and was ordained a priest on 20 December 1959. Later he received a social sciences degree from University College in Dublin.\n[edit] Priesthood\nReturning to Wellington, he served as assistant pastor and as Director of Studies at the Catholic Enquiry Centre. He left that post when he volunteered to serve as a missionary in Samoa (today the Archdiocese of Samoa-Apia), where he was parish priest for 5 years. He returned to New Zealand in 1963 and became parish priest at St. Patrick's in Palmerston North for two years. This was followed by four years as Director of the Catholic Enquiry Centre in Wellington. In 1971 he moved to Leulumoega, Samoa and returned to New Zealand in 1976 to the Holy Family Parish in Porirua East, one of the Archdiocese's most multi-cultural parishes.[citation needed]\n[edit] Church Leader\nHe became Archbishop of Wellington on 20 December 1979 - his 20th anniversary of priestly ordination - following the death of Reginald Cardinal Delargey. His principal consecrator was Owen Snedden, long-term Auxiliary Bishop of Wellington. Williams was subsequently created Cardinal-Priest of the titular church of Jesus the Divine Teacher at Pineta Sacchetti by Pope John Paul II on 2 February 1983.\n\n\nStyles of\nThomas Stafford Williams\n\n\n\n\n\nReference style\nHis Eminence\n\n\nSpoken style\nYour Eminence\n\n\nInformal style\nCardinal\n\n\nSee\nWellington (emeritus)\n\n\nHe was additionally appointed Military Ordinary in 1995. He received New Zealand's highest honour, the Order of New Zealand in 2000.\n[edit] Moral campaigns\nHe campaigned strongly against the passage of the law allowing civil unions in New Zealand saying it would turn New Zealand into a \"moral wasteland\" [1]. He also campaigned against the expansion of casinos [2].\n[edit] Conclave and retirement\nWilliams was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. He resigned from the governance of the Archdiocese of Wellingon on 21 March 2005 and was succeeded by the then Co-Adjutor Archbishop John Atcherley Dew.\n\n\nCatholic Church titles\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by\nReginald Delargey\n5th Archbishop of Wellington\n1979-2005\nSucceeded\u00a0by\nJohn Atcherley Dew\n\n\n\nThomas Stafford Cardinal Williams, Catholic Hierarchy website (retrieved 12 February 2011)\n\n[edit] Selected works\n\nIn his own words: a tribute to Cardinal Thomas Williams.
